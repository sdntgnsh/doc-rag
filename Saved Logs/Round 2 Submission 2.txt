--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body, so in a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.

'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as the Earth and the Moon, are equal and opposite.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravity experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. For two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing that the centripetal forces keeping moons or planets in orbit follow the same inverse square law, as indicated by their periodic times and orbital distances. Thus, the total gravitational force between two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating their centers.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies—planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter—demonstrating a universal principle of attraction among all masses.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities or perturbations in the motion of each planet. The superposition of these gravitational influences alters the orbital elements, such as eccentricity and inclination, resulting in complex, non-Keplerian motion.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and the concept of "fluxions" (his term for derivatives) as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the ancient mathematicians' methods, and was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his aversion to controversy and disputes.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In the case of planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that lighter fluids like air offer less resistance than denser ones like water or mercury, in direct proportion to their densities. The resistance in fluids arises from three sources: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. For sufficiently fluid substances, resistance is mainly due to density and velocity squared. Newton also distinguishes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less tenacious ones, even if their densities are equal. He provides methods to determine the density of the medium and the resistance encountered by a body moving along a given curve, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is immovable and not dependent on any physical objects, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of events. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.

Newton's absolute space and time support his laws by providing a universal frame in which his laws of motion—especially inertia and acceleration—can be objectively defined and measured. This allows for the distinction between true motion (relative to absolute space) and apparent motion (relative to other objects), ensuring the consistency and universality of Newton's laws.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's paternal grandfather was Robert Newton, and his maternal grandfather was James Ayscough.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?
A1. Expenses would NOT be covered if the treatment involves non-medical items such as ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer/thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home except when they form part of room expenses. Additionally, expenses incurred towards treatment by any hospital, Medical Practitioner, or provider specifically excluded by the insurer, or treatments received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments, or for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, are also not covered.

Q2. A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?
A2. Payable items:
- Prosthetic device implanted during hip replacement surgery

Not payable:
- Walker (not payable)
- Lumbar belt (payable only for cases who have undergone surgery of lumbar spine, not hip replacement; therefore, not payable in this case)

Q3. An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A3. The claim is admissible because the child is a dependent above 18 but under 26, unmarried, unemployed, and thus eligible for coverage. Dental surgery expenses are covered if the treatment is for reconstruction following an accident, as exclusions for cosmetic or plastic surgery do not apply in this medically necessary scenario.

Process:
- Submit the claim form along with invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports, all duly signed by the insured person, to the insurer's branch or head office.
- The insurer will assess the claim documents and determine admissibility.
- The claim will be settled or rejected within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document.
- If the dental surgery is for accident-related reconstruction, no exclusion applies, and the claim is payable.

Q4. If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A4. Expenses for Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period for claims involving IONM, as per the modern treatment methods section.

ICU care expenses are covered up to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI) per day (inclusive of nursing charges) as specified in the policy schedule for ICU charges. If the insured is admitted in a higher category room than entitled, the insured will bear the difference of all medical expenses in the same proportion as in the final hospital bill.

Both IONM and ICU expenses are subject to the respective limits in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance and the general policy terms.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. To add a newly-adopted 3-year-old child as a dependent, the policyholder must submit an application for cover during the policy period. The insurer will accept the addition if the application is approved, the additional pro-rata premium for the risk coverage duration is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued.

The insurer may refuse cover if:
- The application for cover is not accepted.
- The required premium is not paid.
- The child does not meet eligibility criteria (children between 91 days and 18 years are eligible if either or both parents are covered).
- The addition is not notified within the required timeframe (on or before the last day of the month following the adoption).
- The minimum group size requirement is not met.
- Any other specific exclusions or conditions in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance apply.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. For the day care cataract procedure:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior in case of planned hospitalisation.
- If using the cashless facility, submit documents immediately after discharge.
- If claiming reimbursement, submit all required documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

For the subsequent inpatient care for complications in a non-network hospital:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier.
- For reimbursement of hospitalisation expenses, submit all required documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.
- For reimbursement of post-hospitalisation expenses, submit documents within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment.

Required documents: All relevant information relating to the claim including plan of treatment, policy number, and any other documents as per the process defined under Clause VI.3 and VI.4.

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. The claim for the insured mother’s complicated C-section is eligible under maternity cover, as medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth, including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections, are covered.

For the newborn’s intensive care treatment expenses:
- New Born Babies are accepted for cover from birth if maternity cover is opted and subject to written notification on or before the last day of the month following birth and receipt of the agreed premium.
- The newborn is defined as a baby born during the policy period and aged up to 90 days.
- However, claim eligibility for the newborn’s treatment expenses is subject to the New Born Baby Benefit Cover limitations and the requirement that the insurer is notified in writing and the premium is paid as specified.
- If these conditions are met (notification and premium payment), the newborn’s intensive care expenses are eligible for claim.
- If notification or premium payment is not completed as required, the claim for the newborn’s treatment expenses is not eligible.

In summary: The mother’s C-section expenses are covered. The newborn’s intensive care expenses are covered only if the insurer is notified in writing and the agreed premium is paid within the specified period; otherwise, the claim is not eligible.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient. The required documents for an inpatient psychiatric treatment claim include a discharge certificate/summary from the hospital and a prescription from the attending medical practitioner. The definitions specify that a Medical Practitioner must hold valid registration from the Medical Council of India or a State Medical Council. A general practitioner’s prescription is acceptable if the practitioner is registered as required. However, a discharge summary certified only by a Clinical Psychologist is not sufficient, as a Clinical Psychologist is not recognized as a Medical Practitioner under the policy rules. The discharge summary must be certified by a registered Medical Practitioner (such as a psychiatrist or physician) with the appropriate medical council registration. Therefore, both the prescription and the discharge summary must be from eligible medical practitioners as defined, not solely from a Clinical Psychologist.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. ECG electrodes are admissible up to 5 electrodes for every case visiting OT or ICU; for longer ICU stays, at least one set every second day is payable. Gloves are not listed as payable and are considered non-medical expenses, so they are not admissible.

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Pre-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred 18 days before admission for the same illness can be claimed, provided they fall within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is accepted.

Post-hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge for the same illness can also be claimed, provided they are within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is accepted.

Both claims are subject to reimbursement, the expenses must be related to the same illness or injury for which hospitalisation was required, and the total claimable amount is limited to the lesser of the actual expenses incurred or the specified policy limits.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period, their coverage ceases when they are no longer eligible as a dependent, which is upon turning 27. Coverage does not continue until the end of the policy period, even if the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year. The child must be deleted from the policy effective from the date they cease to be a dependent, i.e., their 27th birthday. A pro-rata refund of premium may be provided, provided no claim is paid or outstanding for that insured person.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. Associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, will be reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rent per day bears to the actual room rent per day, as per the Proportionate Clause. This applies because the insured opted for a room exceeding the allowed limit and differential billing is followed for these expenses. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause for Clause III.A.1.A.

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation and the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, the company may have already sent up to three reminders and may have settled or deducted the deficient amount if the claim was otherwise valid. If the claim is finally rejected, the company must communicate the rejection in writing, explicitly stating the grounds, within 15 days from receipt of the final documents or investigation report.

The insured person then has 15 days from receipt of the rejection to represent to the company for reconsideration. If the claim is not the subject of any pending suit or proceeding and is not pursued within twelve months from the date of rejection or partial settlement, the claim is deemed abandoned and the company’s liability is extinguished.

If there is a delay in claim settlement beyond the stipulated period (15 days from receipt of last necessary document, or 45 days if investigation is required), the company must pay interest at 2% above the bank rate from the date of receipt of last necessary document to the date of payment. Grievances can be redressed as per the policy’s grievance redressal procedures.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the "Day Care Treatment" category.

Requirements for eligibility:
- The procedure is undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement.
- The procedure would have otherwise required hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.
- Treatment normally taken on an out-patient basis is not included.

Since the insured person was hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia, and the procedure would have previously required more than 24 hours, it qualifies as Day Care Treatment.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. In a town with less than 1 million population, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. In metropolitan areas (population 1 million or more), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. The difference is the minimum number of in-patient beds required: 10 for smaller towns, 15 for larger cities.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A16. Eligibility criteria:

- New employee: Must be an employee of the policyholder (employer-employee relationship).
- Spouse: Must be the employee’s legal spouse or life partner (including live-in partner).
- Sibling: Must be the employee’s sibling, unmarried/unemployed, dependent, and up to the age of 26 years.

Documentation and process required:

- Application for cover for each person.
- Additional premium on a pro-rata basis for the risk coverage duration.
- Written request for endorsement by the policyholder.
- Any additional information/documents as requested by the underwriter.
- Endorsement confirmation from the insurer for the addition.
- For siblings, proof of relationship, age, dependency, and marital/employment status may be required.
- For spouse, proof of marriage or partnership may be required.
- Coverage is effective from the date of joining/payment of premium, subject to maintenance of adequate cash deposit or payment.

Required documents: Application for cover, proof of employment (for employee), proof of relationship (for spouse and sibling), proof of age (for sibling), proof of dependency and marital/employment status (for sibling), and any other documents as requested by the insurer.

Q17. Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A17. Robotic surgery for cancer is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, whether performed as a day care procedure or as inpatient hospitalization. For claims involving malignancies (cancer), the same sub-limit applies in both scenarios. Additionally, for modern treatments as per IRDAI, including robotic surgeries, coverage is restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. For air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission due to an accident, the following steps and requirements must be followed:

Pre-Authorization:
- Notify the insurer or TPA at the call centre or in writing immediately upon the occurrence of the accident.
- Submit a pre-authorization request to the TPA/hospital, providing all relevant medical details.
- Provide all required medical information as requested by the TPA; failure to do so may result in denial of pre-authorization.
- In case of admission in a PPN hospital, submit the duly filled and signed PPN declaration format available with the hospital.
- Settle all non-admissible expenses, expenses above specified sub-limits, co-payments, and/or opted deductibles directly with the hospital.

Claims Assessment (Reimbursement Process):
- Notify the insurer or TPA within 10 days from the date of the accident.
- Follow the treatment as per the directions and advice of the treating medical practitioner.
- Submit to medical examination by the insurer’s medical practitioner or authorized representative if requested.
- Permit inspection of medical and hospitalization records by the insurer or its representatives.
- Provide all reasonable cooperation for claim investigation and assessment.
- Submit all required documents for reimbursement, including those mentioned in the Base Cover claim reimbursement process and any additional documents specific to the air ambulance and inpatient admission.
- For pre and post-hospitalization claims, submit cash receipts along with supporting documents.

Mandatory Requirements and Documentation:
- Timely notification of claim (within 10 days).
- Pre-authorization request with complete medical details.
- Duly filled and signed PPN declaration format (if admitted in PPN hospital).
- All original bills, receipts, and supporting medical documents.
- Cooperation with medical examination and investigation if required.
- Submission of all documents as per the Base Cover and any additional documents required for air ambulance and inpatient admission.

Failure to comply with these steps and requirements may prejudice the claim.

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If the insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer and recently ported to this policy, the waiting period for a specific illness (such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) will be reduced by the duration of prior coverage, as per IRDAI portability guidelines. The insured will receive accrued continuity benefits for waiting periods, provided there was no break in coverage.

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. The expense for an imported medication not normally used in India will not be covered if the treatment is considered experimental or unproven according to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India. For coverage, the treatment must be medically necessary, prescribed by a medical practitioner, and conform to accepted professional standards. If the medication is not recognized as standard treatment in India and is experimental or unproven, the expense is not admissible.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. In a non-employer group policy, if a member dies during the policy period, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured, as specified in the Policy Schedule.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), the required supporting documentation includes:  
- Duly completed claim form  
- Photo ID and Age proof  
- Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents  
- Attending medical practitioner's/surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/nature of operation performed, with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports, and prescription  
- Medical history and all previous consultation papers, bills (with break-up of charges), and payment receipts supported by prescription  
- Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital  
- Original final hospital bill with detailed break-up and all original deposit and final payment receipts  
- **Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries (e.g., stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery)**  
- All original diagnostic reports with prescription and invoice/bill with receipt from diagnostic center  
- All original medicine/pharmacy bills with prescription  
- Other documents as applicable (MLC/FIR in accidental cases, death summary/certificate in death claims, pre and post-operative imaging reports, indoor case papers, cheque copy or bank details)

If only a generic invoice is provided without the implant sticker, the claim may be delayed, queried, or denied, as the original invoice with payment receipt and implant sticker is specifically required to support the claim for implanted devices.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges after discharge qualify for reimbursement if:

- The home nursing is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to provide expert nursing services immediately after discharge.
- The claim for in-patient hospitalisation for the accident is accepted by the insurance company.
- The home nursing expenses are for the same condition for which hospitalisation was required.
- The expenses are incurred within the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Required documentation:

- Proof that the home nursing was arranged by the hospital.
- Valid registration details of the Qualified Nurse from the Nursing Council of India or a state Nursing Council.
- Hospital discharge summary indicating the date of last discharge.
- Bills and receipts for home nursing services.
- Confirmation that the in-patient hospitalisation claim has been accepted.
- Any other documents specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. If the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer will seek details of other available policies of the policyholder and coordinate with other Insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided a written request for the same has been submitted by the Insured Person. If original documents have been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified documents listed under clause VI.5.1 and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer, subject to the company's satisfaction.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded and not claimable. If the hospitalization was solely for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, with no treatment provided, these expenses are not admissible under the policy as per the stated exclusions. Only expenses related to diagnosis and treatment of an illness or injury for which hospitalization was required are covered, provided the claim is otherwise admissible. Diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment are also excluded.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. If the previous nominee has suddenly died and there is no prior endorsement for nominee change, the insurer will pay the claim amount to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. Their discharge will be treated as full and final discharge of the insurer’s liability under the policy.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered in the following scenarios, even if associated with hospitalization:

- When they are not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the insured person was hospitalized.
- When used for diagnosis and treatment but are ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer, thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home (except when forming part of room expenses).
- When they are not medically necessary or not part of the recuperation process on a short-term basis.
- When they are for cosmetic or plastic surgery or to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk, certified by the attending medical practitioner.
- When they are not prescribed by a registered medical practitioner or are from a practitioner not licensed for the relevant discipline.
- When they are included in the list of non-medical expenses as per Annexure I “Non-Medical Expenses.”

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. Expenses will not be reimbursed because the AYUSH hospital must be registered with local authorities, wherever applicable, in addition to having qualified practitioners. Registration is a mandatory criterion for admissibility of claims.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. The network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA for the revised diagnosis, treatment plan, or increased cost during hospitalization, following the specified process. This ensures continued cashless eligibility.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. The pre-hospitalisation medical expenses claim will be processed only after the main hospitalisation claim has been decided. If submitted before approval of the main inpatient hospitalisation claim, it will not be processed until the main claim decision is made.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A31. The policyholder's contact details are not provided in the context.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Claims cannot be approved automatically. The process requires submission of a duly completed claim form and original documents, medical examination if requested, cooperation in investigation, and scrutiny of documents by the insurer or TPA. Any deficiencies must be addressed, and claims are processed only after these steps are completed. Automatic approval is not permitted under the defined process.

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. For a claim with missing documents, the deficiency will be intimated to the insured, and if not rectified within 10 working days (with up to 3 reminders), the insurer may deduct the deficient amount and settle the valid part of the claim. For a claim with forged (fraudulent) documents, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited, and any amount already paid must be repaid by the claimant(s), who are jointly and severally liable. The company will not repudiate the claim for fraud if the insured can prove the misstatement was unintentional and not deliberate.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. No, you cannot receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization. Only expenses directly related to the same illness or injury for which in-patient hospitalization was accepted are covered, and certain exclusions apply.

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide (as per the context):

- Treatment in any hospital or by any Medical Practitioner or provider specifically excluded by the Insurer and disclosed on its website/notified to policyholders (except for life-threatening situations or accidents up to stabilization stage).
- Treatment for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, or any addictive condition and consequences thereof.
- Treatments received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments, or private beds registered as a nursing home.
- Cosmetic or plastic surgery or any treatment to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, or cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk (must be certified by the attending Medical Practitioner).
- Treatment for injuries or illnesses resulting from hazardous or adventure sports.
- Costs of donor screening or costs incurred in an organ transplant surgery involving organs not harvested from a human body.
- Any form of alternative treatment.
- Treatments not supported by a prescription.

Q36. How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A36. I’m sorry, but I cannot assist with that request. Submitting fraudulent claims is illegal and unethical.

A6. For a scheduled caesarean delivery at a hospital not in the company's approved list, maternity expenses will not be covered, as coverage is limited to network or approved hospitals.

Mid-term dependent inclusion for a newborn is possible from 1 day of birth or at the time of renewal of the policy. For members subsequently added, Exclusion No. 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C will apply from the date of their inclusion in the policy.
