--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body, so for a body with double the mass at equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.

'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as a planet and the Sun, are equal and opposite.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun (gravity). This central force produces zero torque about the Sun, so the planet's angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing the motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow Kepler’s laws and thus require a centripetal force that varies inversely with the square of the distance from the center. Newton further explains that the total gravitational force from a planet is the sum of the forces from all its parts, each following the inverse square law, and this law holds accurately at large distances and nearly so near the planet’s surface.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate toward each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The moon gravitates toward the earth, the sea gravitates toward the moon, all planets mutually gravitate toward one another, and comets gravitate toward the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This universal gravitation applies to every particle of matter, establishing that all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to changes in orbital elements such as eccentricity, inclination, and orientation. The superposition of these forces results in complex, time-dependent variations in each planet’s trajectory, known as orbital perturbations.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he admired the taste and form of demonstration of the ancients, preferring geometric proofs, and he regretted not following their style more closely. Additionally, he was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his repugnance to contest or dispute.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He distinguishes between different types of resistance—arising from the inactivity of the fluid, the tenacity of its parts, or friction. In sufficiently fluid media like air, water, and certain oils, resistance is mainly proportional to density. He also notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones of equal density. Newton provides methods to determine the density of the medium and the resistance encountered by a body moving along a given curve, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and does not depend on the position or motion of objects, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of events. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.

Newton's laws, especially the first law (law of inertia), require a fixed reference frame to define true motion and rest. Absolute space and time provide this universal frame, allowing Newton to distinguish between true motion (relative to absolute space) and apparent motion (relative to other objects). This distinction is essential for formulating and applying his laws of motion consistently.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage.

A2. Based on the policy terms, here is the payability of the items mentioned:

*   **Prosthetic device:** Payable, as the policy covers the "cost of prosthetic devices implanted during surgical procedure."
*   **Walker:** Not payable, as "Walking Aids Charges" are listed as not payable.
*   **Lumbar belt:** Not payable for a hip replacement. The policy states that a "Lumbo Sacral Belt" is only "Payable for cases who have undergone surgery of lumbar spine."

Q3. An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A3. ### Claim Admissibility

The claim is admissible, subject to specific conditions.

1.  **Eligibility of Dependent:** A child above 18 and under 26 is eligible for coverage as a dependent, provided they are unmarried and unemployed.
2.  **Dental Exclusion Clause:** While dental surgery is generally excluded, the policy makes a specific exception for treatment "necessitated due to an Accident and requiring minimum 24 hours Hospitalisation." Since the surgery is due to an accident, it is covered under this exception, provided the hospital stay is for at least 24 hours.

### Claim Process for Accidental Dental Surgery

**1. Notification of Claim:**
You must notify the Third Party Administrator (TPA) in writing within 24 hours from the date of the emergency hospitalization or before discharge, whichever is earlier.

**2. Required Documents for Reimbursement:**
The claim must be supported by the following original documents and submitted within 15 days from the date of discharge:

*   Duly completed claim form;
*   Photo ID and Age proof;

Q4. If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A4. Based on the policy documents, the limits for the specified expenses are as follows:

*   **Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM):** As one of the "12 Modern treatments as per IRDAI," the expense for IONM is restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).

*   **ICU Care:** The expense for ICU care is limited to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI), which is inclusive of nursing charges. While the policy defines hospital criteria based on city population (e.g., requiring at least 15 beds in cities with over 1,000,000 people), this does not change the ICU expense limit, which remains at 4% of the SI.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. Based on the provided policy document, here is the process and potential reasons for refusal for adding a newly-adopted 3-year-old child:

### **Process for Adding the Child**

The policyholder must submit a written request to add the child. The child is eligible for coverage under the following conditions:

*   **Eligibility by Age:** The child, being 3 years old, falls within the eligible age bracket of 91 days to 18 years.
*   **Parental Coverage:** A parent must be concurrently covered under the policy for the child to be eligible.
*   **Premium Payment:** A prorated premium will be charged for the new dependent from the date of addition until the policy expires.

### **Circumstances for Refusal of Cover**

The insurer may refuse to cover the child under the following circumstances:

1.  **Ineligibility:** If the parent (the employee/member) is not concurrently covered under the policy.
2.  **Non-disclosure or Fraud:** If the policyholder commits fraud, misrepresentation, or fails to disclose any material fact regarding the child.
3.  **Procedural Lapses:** The policy specifies a 30-day window from the inception date for additions. While not explicitly stated for adoption, a request made outside a contractually defined period for life events may be refused.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. Based on the policy, the claim process for both the day care procedure and the subsequent hospitalization for complications would be on a reimbursement basis, as the latter occurred in a non-network hospital. The complication, occurring within 45 days, is considered a relapse and part of the same illness claim.

### **1. Claim Process for Day Care Cataract Procedure**

Since this is typically a planned procedure, you must follow the reimbursement process.

*   **Claim Notification:** You must notify the TPA at least 48 hours prior to admission to the hospital.
*   **Document Submission:** After discharge, you must submit the required documents to the TPA within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of discharge.

*   All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) along with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice / bill with receipt from diagnostic center;
*   All original medicine / pharmacy bills along with the Medical Practitioner's prescription;
*   MLC / FIR copy in Accidental cases only;
*   Copy of death summary and copy of death certificate (in death claims only);
*   Pre and post-operative imaging reports;
*   Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history of the Insured Person, treatment details and the Insured Person's progress;
*   Cheque copy with name of proposer printed on the cheque leaf or copy of the first page of the bank passbook or the bank statement not later than 3 months.

### **2. Claim Process for Complications (Inpatient Care)**

Since this is an emergency hospitalization in a non-network hospital, you must pay the expenses upfront and file for reimbursement.

*   **Claim Notification:** You must notify the TPA within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalization or before discharge from the hospital, whichever is earlier.
*   **Document Submission:** You must submit the required documents to the TPA within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of discharge.

**Required Documents for Reimbursement:**
The same set of original documents as listed above is required for the inpatient care claim.

A7. Based on the policy terms, the newborn's intensive care treatment expenses are eligible for a claim.

Here is the breakdown based on the provided document:

*   **Newborn Coverage:** The policy explicitly states under "Other Special Condition Details" that the "Baby Covered from Day 1 within Family Sum Insured" (Page 4). This means the newborn is considered an insured person from the moment of birth.
*   **Eligibility:** The conditions for this coverage, as per the "Eligibility" clause (Page 27), are that the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted for, which is the case in this scenario.
*   **Definition:** The infant qualifies as a "New Born Baby," which is defined as a "baby born during the Policy period and is aged up to 90 days" (Page 19).
*   **Exclusions:** While the policy excludes "Medical treatment expenses traceable to child birth" (Page 25), this typically refers to the standard costs of the delivery procedure itself, which are covered under the mother's separate Maternity Benefit. The newborn's need for separate intensive care is a distinct medical event for a newly insured person and is therefore not subject to this exclusion.

Therefore, the costs for the intensive care the newborn received before expiring are admissible for a claim under the family's sum insured.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient.

Here is the justification based on the policy document:

1.  **Eligible Practitioners for Claim Documentation:** According to the claim procedure for reimbursement (Clause VI.A.5.i.iv), the claim must be supported by an "Attending **medical practitioner's / surgeon's** certificate regarding diagnosis".
2.  **Definition of "Medical Practitioner":** The policy defines a "Medical Practitioner" (Clause II.A.26) as a person with a valid registration from the Medical Council of India or equivalent, which includes a General Practitioner and a Psychiatrist.
3.  **Definition of "Clinical Psychologist":** A "Clinical Psychologist" is defined under "Mental Healthcare Professional" (Clause II.B.27) but is not classified as a "Medical Practitioner" or "Surgeon".

Therefore, while a General Practitioner's prescription is valid, the discharge summary and diagnostic certificate for an inpatient psychiatric claim must be from the attending **Medical Practitioner** (in this case, a **Psychiatrist**), not a Clinical Psychologist, to be considered sufficient for claim processing.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. Based on the annexures provided, here is the admissibility for the requested items:

*   **ECG Electrodes:** Payable, with the constraint that "Up to 5 electrodes are required for every case visiting OT or ICU. For longer stay in ICU, may require a change and at least one set every second day is payable."
*   **Gloves:** Payable, with the constraint that "Sterilized Gloves payable / unsterilized gloves not payable".

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Based on the policy, both pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed in this scenario.

*   **Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses:** The policy covers actual medical expenses incurred for up to **30 days** before the date of hospital admission for the same illness. Since the expenses occurred 18 days before admission, they fall within the covered period.

*   **Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses:** The policy covers actual medical expenses incurred for up to **60 days** immediately after discharge from the hospital for the same condition. As the expenses for diagnostics and pharmacy were incurred 20 days after discharge, they are within the covered period.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. Based on the document, a dependent child is eligible for coverage up to the age of 26. When a dependent insured person ceases to be a dependent (e.g., by turning 27), their coverage ends.

However, the policy includes a specific provision stating that coverage can continue until the end of the policy period if it has been "otherwise agreed specifically." Since the premium was paid for the entire coverage year, this implies an agreement for coverage to last until the policy's expiry date. The dependent would then be deleted from the policy at the time of the next renewal.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. In case of admission to a room with a rent higher than the eligible limit, the reimbursement for all associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, will be made on a proportionate basis.

This is governed by the **Proportionate Clause**, as detailed in **Note 1** under the In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover section (Clause III.A.1). The clause states that the reimbursement of all associated medical expenses "shall be effected in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of Room Rent."

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. Based on the policy document, here is the course of action:

1.  **Document Deficiency and Resubmission:**
    *   The TPA/Insurer will scrutinize the claim and inform the insured of any missing documents.
    *   The insured has 10 working days from the first intimation to provide the necessary documents. The insurer will send a maximum of three reminders.

2.  **Claim Rejection Timeline:**
    *   After receiving the final necessary documents, the company must settle or reject the claim within 15 days.
    *   If the claim is rejected, the company will communicate the grounds for rejection in writing.

3.  **Contesting the Final Rejection:**
    *   **Step 1: Reconsideration:** The insured person may, within 15 days of receiving the rejection, request that the insurer reconsider the decision.
    *   **Step 2: Grievance Redressal:** If still unsatisfied, the insured can contact the company's grievance redressal channels:
        *   **Website:** www.uiic.co.in
        *   **Toll free:** 1800 425 333 33
        *   **E-mail:** customercare@uiic.co.in
        *   **Courier:** Customer Care Department, Head Office, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014
    *   **Step 3: Grievance Officer:** If the issue persists, the insured may contact the grievance officer at customercare@uiic.co.in.
    *   **Step 4: External Authorities:** If still not satisfied, the insured can approach the **Insurance Ombudsman** of the respective region or lodge a grievance at the **IRDAI Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS)** at https://igms.irda.gov.in/.

Finally, if a claim is rejected and not pursued through a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, it is considered abandoned, and the insurer's liability is extinguished.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the **Day Care Treatment** category.

According to the policy, Day Care Treatment is defined as a medical treatment and/or surgical procedure which is:
i. undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement, and
ii. which would have otherwise required a hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. For a hospital to qualify under this policy, it must meet several minimum criteria. The requirements that differ based on population are:

*   **In towns with a population of less than 10,00,000 (1 million):** The hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds.
*   **In all other places (including metropolitan areas):** The hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds.

Additionally, all qualifying hospitals, regardless of location, must meet the following infrastructure and service requirements:
*   Has qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock.
*   Has qualified medical practitioner(s) in charge round the clock.
*   Has a fully equipped operation theatre of its own where surgical procedures are carried out.
*   Maintains daily records of patients and makes these accessible to the insurance company's authorized personnel.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A16. Based on the policy document, here are the eligibility criteria and documentation process for adding a new employee, their spouse, and sibling:

### **Eligibility Criteria**

*   **New Employee:** Must be a newly appointed employee of the policyholder.
*   **Spouse:** Must be the employee's legal spouse.
*   **Sibling:** Must be the employee's sibling, up to the age of 26 years, and must be unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.

### **Process and Documentation**

The policyholder must provide written notification to the insurer with the details of the eligible persons to be added. The addition is subject to the following conditions:
1.  The insurer accepts the application for cover.
2.  An additional premium is paid on a pro-rata basis for the remaining policy duration.
3.  The insurer issues a written endorsement confirming the addition.

The policy specifies that for any endorsement, "additional information/documents/ premium may be requested" by the underwriter as part of the assessment.

Q17. Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A17. Based on the policy document, robotic surgery for malignancies (cancer) is covered whether performed as an inpatient or day care procedure.

The coverage limit is "up to the limit as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period for claims involving Robotic Surgeries for... Malignancies."

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. For an air ambulance evacuation necessitated by an accident, the following steps and documentation are required:

### **Mandatory Pre-authorization Steps**

In the event of an emergency requiring air ambulance evacuation, you must follow these steps for pre-authorization:

1.  **Immediate Notification:** The Insured Person or their representative must notify the insurer immediately, either at their call center or in writing.
2.  **Mandatory Pre-authorization:** All emergency medical evacuations must be pre-authorized by the insurer.
3.  **Medical Necessity Assessment:** The insurer's team of specialists, in association with the emergency assistance service provider, will determine the medical necessity of the evacuation and repatriation. The evacuation will only be approved after this assessment is complete.

### **Required Documents for Claims Assessment**

For the claim to be assessed and reimbursed, you must submit the following documents:

*   **Specific to Air Ambulance:**
    *   Air ambulance ticket from a registered service provider.

*   **General Inpatient Admission Documents:**
    *   Duly completed claim form
    *   Photo ID and Age proof
    *   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents
    *   Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.
    *   Medical history of the patient as recorded (All previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for current ailment), bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner/ hospital.

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. For specific illnesses like knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis, there is a designated waiting period. However, if an insured person has been continuously covered without any break under a previous policy and ports to this one, the waiting period for that illness will be reduced to the extent of the prior coverage period, in accordance with IRDAI portability norms.

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. Based on the policy terms, the expense for an imported medication not normally used in India is unlikely to be covered. The policy contains several clauses that would likely lead to the denial of such a claim.

Relevant clauses include:

*   **Medically Necessary Treatment (Clause II.A.27):** For a treatment to be covered, it must, among other criteria, "conform to the professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India" and must not be "experimental, investigational or for research purposes." An imported drug not standard in India could be deemed experimental or not conforming to accepted standards.

*   **Unproven Treatments (Clause IV.B.16, Code-Excl16):** The policy excludes "Expenses related to any unproven treatment, services and supplies... Unproven treatments are treatments, procedures or supplies that lack significant medical documentation to support their effectiveness." The insurer could classify a non-standard imported drug as unproven.

*   **Specific Exclusions (Clause IV.C.7):** The policy excludes "Any treatment or part of a treatment that... is not a Medically Necessary Treatment." This directly links back to the definition above, reinforcing that if the medication is not considered medically necessary by the insurer's standards, it will not be covered.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. For a non-employer employee group, the policy states that the rules for the deletion of a member are "As specified in the Policy Schedule."

However, for an employer-employee group, the policy specifies: "In the event of death of an employee, his/her dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured."

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. For claims involving implanted devices, the required documentation is the **Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery**.

If a generic invoice without an implant sticker is provided, it will be considered a deficiency in the required claim documents. The insurer will notify the claimant of this deficiency. If the required documentation is not provided after reminders, the insurer may, at its sole discretion, deduct the amount of the claim for which the documentation is deficient and settle the remainder of the claim if it is otherwise valid.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges are covered under the following circumstances:
*   The service is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to provide expert nursing services at the patient's home.
*   It must occur immediately after hospital treatment.
*   The service must be deemed a medical necessity for treatment that would normally be provided in a hospital.
*   The Specialist who treated the patient must have recommended these services.

The required documentation for reimbursement is:
*   Bills from the registered nursing service provider.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. In a multi-policy scenario where the primary policy's coverage is insufficient for the admissible claim amount, the following procedure applies:

**Procedure and Coordination:**
The primary insurer will seek the details of the policyholder's other available policies and will coordinate with the other insurers to ensure the settlement of the balance amount, provided a written request for this has been submitted by the Insured Person.

**Required Documentation:**
When the original documents have been submitted to the other insurer, the company may accept the following, subject to its satisfaction:
*   Duly certified claim documents as listed under clause VI.5.1.
*   Claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. No, these expenses are not claimable.

According to the policy's "Standard Permanent Exclusions," specifically under **Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04)**, "Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded."

Furthermore, under "Specific Exclusions" (Clause C.16), the policy excludes "Any stay in Hospital without undertaking any Treatment or any other purpose other than for receiving eligible Treatment..."

Since the hospitalization was solely for evaluation and no treatment was administered, the expenses fall under these explicit exclusions and are not payable.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. In the event of the policyholder's death where there is no subsisting nominee, the company will pay the claim to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. The payment is made to the legal heir who holds a succession certificate or an indemnity bond to that effect. Such a payment is considered a full and final discharge of the company's liability under the policy.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Based on the policy's definitions and exclusions, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered in the following scenarios, even if associated with hospitalization:

1.  **When not required intra-operatively:** Prostheses, corrective devices, and/or Medical Appliances that are not required *during* the surgical procedure for the illness or injury are excluded.
2.  **For routine vision or hearing correction:** The cost of spectacles, multifocal lenses, contact lenses, and hearing aids are not covered.
3.  **For external use during or after treatment:** The policy excludes instruments like a C.P.A.P. machine for Sleep Apnea, an Oxygen Concentrator for Bronchial Asthma, an infusion pump, or any other external devices used during or after treatment.
4.  **For convenience or home use:** Non-medical expenses are excluded, which include a wide range of items for personal comfort or home use, such as:
    *   Ambulatory devices (walkers, crutches)
    *   Belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings
    *   Diabetic footwear
    *   Glucometers or thermometers
    *   Any medical equipment subsequently used at home (unless it forms part of the room expenses).

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. No, the expenses will not be reimbursed.

According to the policy, AYUSH treatment is only covered in Government Recognised hospitals that are NABH Approved. Furthermore, the general definition of a "Hospital" requires the institution to be registered with the local authorities. Since the hospital in the scenario is not locally registered, it does not meet the policy's requirements for reimbursement.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. In the event of any change in the diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost of treatment during hospitalization, the network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. According to the policy, the pre-hospitalization medical expenses cover claim will be processed only after a decision has been made on the main hospitalization claim.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A31. Based on the document, here are the contact details for the policyholder, M/s DATA SOLUTIONS INDIA:

**Address:** 4TH FLOOR, 1, BLOCK A, DLF INDUSTRIAL AREA, SECTOR 32, FARIDABAD HARYANA 121003, ΗΥΡΑ AXIS BANK LTD FARIDABAD, FARIDABAD HARYANA 121003.

The telephone number and email address for the policyholder are not listed in the provided document.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Answer not present in documents

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. If a claim is fraudulent, or if a false statement or declaration is made in its support, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Any amount already paid against a fraudulent claim must be repaid to the insurer.

For claims with missing or deficient documents, the insurer will notify the insured person. If the deficiency is not resolved after a maximum of three reminders, the insurer may, at its discretion, deduct the amount of the claim for which the information is deficient and settle the remainder of the claim if it is otherwise valid.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. Based on the policy document, reimbursement for expenses is primarily for costs related to in-patient hospitalization.

However, the policy includes an **Out-Patient Cover** as an optional benefit. You can receive reimbursement for out-patient expenses, such as doctor's consultations and prescribed medicines that do not require hospitalization, only if this optional cover was specifically selected and is part of your policy.

The policy also covers:
*   **Pre-hospitalization Medical Expenses:** Costs incurred for up to 30 days immediately before an admissible hospitalization.
*   **Post-hospitalization Medical Expenses:** Costs incurred for up to 60 days immediately after discharge from an admissible hospitalization.

General treatments that could be done on an out-patient basis without any hospitalization are otherwise listed as a specific exclusion.

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Based on the document provided, the following is excluded:

Treatment received outside India.

Q36. How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A36. I cannot fulfill this request. Submitting fraudulent claims is an illegal and unethical activity.

According to the policy document, if any claim is found to be fraudulent, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Additionally, any amount already paid against a fraudulent claim must be repaid to the insurer.

**3. Sibling Dependency:**

According to the policy's definition of "Family" (Clause 2.13 D), coverage is available for **"Unmarried siblings, if financially dependent."** The policy does not specify an age limit for siblings. Therefore, a sibling above 26 can be covered as long as they are unmarried and financially dependent on the insured person.

Q3. While inquiring about the maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law, simultaneously provide the claim notification procedure, and confirm the process to replace a lost ID card for another dependent.
