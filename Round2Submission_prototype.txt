--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.

'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' because it arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction Law): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies the effect of gravitational force on planetary acceleration. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies, ensuring that forces between two bodies are equal and opposite.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravitational force experiences a central force—meaning the force always points toward the Sun. According to Newton's laws of motion, a central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law. Key concepts: central force, conservation of angular momentum, equal areas in equal times.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is inversely as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship holds for the total gravitational force, which is compounded from the forces towards all parts of a mass, and is confirmed by the observed motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow the same law. Thus, the force of gravity between two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to their quantity of matter. The moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, all planets towards each other, and comets towards the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This universal gravitation applies to every particle of matter, meaning all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these gravitational influences results in complex, perturbed paths rather than simple two-body motion.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the demonstrations of the ancients, and was reluctant to engage in disputes over mathematical methods.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force, directed toward the center of the orbit, causes the body to accelerate toward the center, preventing it from moving in a straight line. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable elliptical orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the medium and the square of the velocity. He distinguishes between different types of resistance—arising from the inactivity of the fluid, the tenacity of its parts, or friction. In sufficiently fluid media like air, water, and certain oils, resistance is mainly due to density and velocity squared. He also notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones of equal density. Newton analyzes how resistance affects motion, including circular and projected motion, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.

Newton's laws, especially the first law (inertia) and the second law (F=ma), require a universal, non-arbitrary frame to define true motion and acceleration. Absolute space and time provide this objective framework, allowing for the distinction between true motion (absolute) and apparent motion (relative), and ensuring the consistent application of his laws of motion.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Robert Newton and James Ayscough.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. Newton never married and had no children, so no direct descendants exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?
A1. Expenses would NOT be covered if the treatment involves non-medical items such as ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer/thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home (except when part of room expenses), or if the treatment is received from a provider specifically excluded by the insurer. Additionally, expenses are not covered if the treatment is for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, or if received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments.

Q2. A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?
A2. Payable items:
- Prosthetic device used during hip replacement surgery (covered as a surgical implant)
- Lumbar belt (payable only if the patient underwent surgery of the lumbar spine; not payable for hip replacement)
- Walker (not payable)

Therefore, only the prosthetic device used during the hip replacement surgery is payable. The walker and lumbar belt (for hip surgery) are not payable.

Q3. An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A3. The claim is admissible because the child is a dependent above 18 but under 26, unmarried, unemployed, and thus eligible for coverage. Dental surgery expenses are covered if the treatment is for reconstruction following an accident, as exclusions for cosmetic or plastic surgery do not apply in this medically necessary scenario.

Process:
- Submit the claim form along with invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports, all duly signed by the insured person, to the insurer's branch or head office.
- The insurer will assess the claim documents and determine admissibility.
- The claim will be settled or rejected within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document.
- If pre-authorization is required (e.g., for certain dental procedures), provide a full description of the proposed treatment, X-rays and study models, and an estimate of the cost before treatment starts, so the insurer can confirm the benefit payable.
- Any benefit is payable only if authorized before treatment starts, where pre-authorization is mandated.

Q4. If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A4. Expenses for Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period for claims involving IONM, subject to the overall cap for modern treatments (restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured as per special conditions).

ICU charges, including ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges, are covered up to 4% of the Sum Insured per day (inclusive of nursing charges) as specified in the policy schedule. If admitted to a higher category room, the insured must bear the proportional difference in all medical expenses.

Both expenses are subject to the respective per-procedure or per-day limits as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the overall terms and conditions of the policy.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. To add a newly-adopted 3-year-old child as a dependent, the policyholder must submit a written application for cover. The insurer will assess the application, and coverage will be effective only after:

- The application is accepted by the insurer,
- The additional pro-rata premium for the risk coverage duration is received,
- An endorsement confirming the addition is issued.

The insurer may refuse cover if:

- The application is not accepted,
- Required premium is not paid,
- Additional information/documents requested by the underwriter are not provided,
- The relationship is not eligible as per the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance,
- The minimum group size requirement is not met.

Eligibility: Children between 91 days and 18 years are eligible if either or both parents are covered. Children above 18 years can be covered up to 26 years if unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.

All changes must be notified on or before the last day of the month following the change.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. For the day care cataract procedure:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior to admission in case of planned hospitalisation.
- If using the cashless facility, submit documents immediately after discharge.
- If claiming reimbursement, submit all required documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

For the subsequent inpatient care for complications in a non-network hospital:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier.
- For reimbursement of hospitalisation expenses, submit all required documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.
- For reimbursement of post-hospitalisation expenses, submit documents within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment.

Required documents: All relevant information relating to the claim including plan of treatment, policy number, and any other documents as per the process defined under Clause VI.3 and VI.4.

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. The newborn’s treatment expenses are eligible for claim only if:

- The policyholder provided written notification to the insurer on or before the last day of the month following the birth and paid the agreed premium for newborn cover.
- The newborn is accepted as an insured person from birth, subject to the limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover.
- Medical treatment expenses for the newborn, including intensive care, are covered if these conditions are met.

However, if the newborn was not notified and premium not paid as required, the claim for the newborn’s treatment expenses will not be admissible.

Exclusions do not apply to the newborn’s intensive care unless the expenses are for ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage (unless due to accident), or lawful medical termination, which is not the case here.

Summary: If the newborn was properly notified and premium paid as per policy terms, treatment expenses for the newborn, including intensive care, are eligible for claim. If not, the claim is not admissible.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient. The required documents for an inpatient psychiatric treatment claim include a certificate or prescription from a Medical Practitioner, which is defined as a person holding valid registration from the Medical Council of any State or the Medical Council of India. A general practitioner’s prescription is acceptable only if the practitioner is registered as a Medical Practitioner under these councils. However, a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist is not sufficient, as a Clinical Psychologist is not recognized as a Medical Practitioner under the policy definitions. The discharge summary must be certified by a qualified doctor (Medical Practitioner) or psychiatrist registered with the Medical Council. Therefore, both the prescription and discharge summary must be from eligible Medical Practitioners as per the policy, not just a Clinical Psychologist.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. ECG electrodes are admissible up to 5 electrodes per case visiting OT or ICU; for longer ICU stays, at least one set every second day is payable. Gloves are not listed as payable and are considered non-medical expenses, so they are not admissible for reimbursement.

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Pre-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred 18 days before admission for the same illness can be claimed, provided they fall within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is admissible.

Post-hospitalisation medical expenses for diagnostics and pharmacy incurred 20 days after discharge for the same illness can be claimed, provided they are within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is admissible.

Both pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses must be related to the same illness or injury for which hospitalisation was required, and claims are reimbursed up to the specified limits or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. Coverage for a dependent child ends when they turn 27, as they are no longer eligible (coverage is only up to age 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent). Even if the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, their coverage terminates immediately upon turning 27. Deletion from the policy should be processed effective from the date the child turns 27, and a pro-rata refund of premium may be provided if no claim has been paid or is outstanding for that Insured Person.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. Associated expenses such as diagnostic and specialist fees will be reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rent per day bears to the actual room rent per day, as per the Proportionate Clause. This proportionate deduction applies because the insured opted for a room exceeding the allowed limit and the hospital follows differential billing. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause under Clause III.A.1.A.

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation and the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, the company may have already deducted the amount related to the deficiency and settled the rest of the claim, or rejected the deficient part. If the company issues a final rejection, it must communicate the grounds for rejection in writing within 15 days from receipt of the final documents or investigation report. The insured then has 15 days from receipt of the rejection to represent to the company for reconsideration. If the claim is not the subject of any pending suit or proceeding and is not pursued within twelve months from the date of rejection or partial settlement, the claim is deemed abandoned and the insurer’s liability is extinguished. If there is a delay in claim payment beyond the stipulated period, the company must pay interest at 2% above the bank rate from the date of receipt of the last necessary document to the date of payment. Grievances can be redressed as per the policy’s grievance redressal mechanism.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the "Day Care Treatment" category.

Requirements:
- Undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement.
- The procedure would have otherwise required hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.
- Treatment normally taken on an out-patient basis is not covered.

Since the insured person was hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia, and the procedure previously required more than 24 hours, it meets the criteria for Day Care Treatment.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. In a town with less than 1 million population, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. In metropolitan areas (towns with a population of 1 million or more), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. The difference is the minimum number of in-patient beds required: 10 for smaller towns and 15 for larger towns or metropolitan areas.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A16. Eligibility criteria:

- New employee: Must be an employee of the policyholder (employer-employee relationship).
- Spouse: Must be the employee’s legal spouse or life partner (including live-in partner).
- Sibling: Must be the employee’s sibling, unmarried/unemployed, dependent, and up to the age of 26 years.

Required documentation:

- Application for cover for each person.
- Proof of employment for the new employee.

- Any additional documents as requested by the underwriter.
- Payment of additional pro-rata premium for the added insured persons.
- Written request for endorsement by the policyholder.

Coverage is subject to acceptance by the insurer, receipt of premium, and issuance of an endorsement confirming the addition.

Q17. Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A17. Coverage for robotic surgery for cancer is provided up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, whether performed as a day care procedure or as inpatient hospitalization. For claims involving malignancies (cancer), the same sub-limit applies in both scenarios. Additionally, modern treatments, including robotic surgeries for cancer, are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. For an accident requiring air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, the following steps and requirements must be followed for pre-authorization and claims assessment:

Pre-Authorization:
- Notify the insurer or TPA at the call centre or in writing within 10 days from the date of the accident.
- Submit a pre-authorization request to the insurer/TPA with all relevant medical details.
- Provide all required information and cooperate with the insurer/TPA for claim investigation and assessment.
- In case of admission in a PPN hospital, submit the duly filled and signed PPN declaration format available with the hospital.
- The TPA may deny pre-authorization if relevant medical details are not provided, but treatment can still proceed and claims can be submitted for reimbursement.

Claims Assessment:
- Settle all non-admissible expenses, expenses above specified sub-limits, co-payments, and deductibles directly with the hospital.
- Submit all required claim documents to the TPA within the prescribed time limit for reimbursement, including cash receipts and supporting documents for pre- and post-hospitalization expenses.
- Allow the insurer/TPA or their authorized representatives to inspect medical and hospitalization records and to examine the insured person if required.
- Provide any additional information or assistance as requested by the insurer/TPA, including authorization to obtain medical and other records.
- All bills, invoices, and medical treatment-related documents must be in the insured person’s name.
- All documents must be submitted electronically to the TPA for

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If the insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer and recently ported to this policy, the waiting period for a specific illness (such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) will be reduced by the duration of prior continuous coverage, as per IRDAI portability guidelines. The insured will get accrued continuity benefits in waiting periods, meaning any waiting period already served under the previous policy will be credited towards the new policy, provided there is no break in coverage. If the sum insured is enhanced, the waiting period will apply afresh only to the increased amount.

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. The expense for an imported medication not normally used in India will not be covered if the treatment is considered experimental or unproven, as only treatments conforming to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India are covered. The medication must be medically necessary, prescribed by a medical practitioner, and not exceed the level of care necessary. If the medication is not recognized as standard treatment in India, it will be excluded under the clause prohibiting experimental or unproven treatments.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. If a member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period, at the option of the insured. Coverage for dependents can continue until policy expiration if this option is chosen.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. Required documents for claims involving implanted devices include:  
- Duly completed claim form  
- Photo ID and Age proof  
- Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents  
- Attending medical practitioner's/surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/nature of operation performed, with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports, and prescription  
- Medical history and all previous consultation papers, bills (with break-up), and payment receipts supported by prescription  
- Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital  
- Original final hospital bill with detailed break-up and all original deposit and final payment receipt  
- **Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries (e.g., stent invoice and sticker in angioplasty surgery)**  
- All original diagnostic reports with prescription and invoice/bill with receipt from diagnostic center  
- All original medicine/pharmacy bills with prescription  
- MLC/FIR copy (in accidental cases only)

- Pre and post-operative imaging reports  
- Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet  
- Cheque copy with name of proposer printed or copy of first page of bank passbook or bank statement not later than 3 months  

If only a generic invoice is provided without the implant sticker, the claim may be rejected or delayed, as submission of both the original invoice and the implant sticker is a mandatory requirement for claims involving implants.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges will qualify for reimbursement if:

- The insured person was hospitalised due to the accident during the policy period.
- The insurance company has accepted the in-patient hospitalisation claim for that accident.
- The home nursing is arranged by the hospital and provided by a Qualified Nurse (registered with the Nursing Council of India or a state council).
- The home nursing is for the same condition for which hospitalisation was required.
- The expenses are incurred within the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Required documentation:

- Discharge summary from the hospital.
- Proof of accepted in-patient hospitalisation claim.
- Written confirmation from the treating Medical Practitioner that home nursing is medically required.
- Bills and receipts for home nursing services.
- Proof of the nurse’s qualification and registration.
- Any other documents specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. If the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer will seek details of other available policies from the policyholder and coordinate with the other Insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the Insured Person submits a written request. If original documents have been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified documents listed under clause VI.5.1 and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer, subject to the company's satisfaction.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. No, these expenses are not claimable. Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are specifically excluded. Additionally, any diagnostic expenses not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded. Since the hospitalization was solely for evaluation and no treatment was required, the claim does not meet the criteria for admissibility.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. If the previous nominee has died and no prior endorsement for nominee change exists, the insurer will pay the claim amount to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. Their discharge will be treated as full and final settlement of the insurer’s liability under the policy.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered in the following scenarios, even if associated with hospitalization:

- When they are not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the insured person was hospitalized.
- When they are ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer, thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home, except when they form part of room expenses.
- When they are not medically necessary or not part of the recuperation process on a short-term basis.
- When they are for cosmetic or plastic surgery or to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk, certified by the attending medical practitioner.
- When they are for external congenital anomaly or defects.
- When they are not prescribed by a medical practitioner as part of a hospitalization claim or day care procedure.
- When they are not of a reasonable charge or not a medically necessary treatment.

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. Expenses will not be reimbursed because the AYUSH hospital must be registered with local authorities to be eligible for claim reimbursement. Registration is a mandatory criterion, regardless of the presence of qualified practitioners.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. The hospital/provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA for the revised diagnosis, treatment plan, or increased cost during hospitalization, following the prescribed process. This ensures continued cashless eligibility.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. A claim for pre-hospitalization expenses will only be processed after the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been decided. Pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses claims are assessed and settled only after approval of the main hospitalization claim.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A31. Processing timed out for this question.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Claims cannot be approved automatically. Each claim must follow the defined process, including submission of required documents, medical examination if requested, cooperation in investigation, and assessment of claim validity and quantum. Automatic approval is not permitted under the stated procedures.

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. Processing timed out for this question.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. No, you cannot receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization. Only expenses directly related to the same illness or injury for which in-patient hospitalization was accepted are covered, and non-related or incidental diagnostic expenses are excluded.

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Processing timed out for this question.

Q36. How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A36. I cannot assist with any requests involving illegal or unethical activities, including submitting fraudulent claims.
