--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass) in a body. It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.

'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction Law): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies the effect of gravitational force on planetary acceleration. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies, ensuring that forces between them are equal and opposite.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun (gravity). This central force produces zero torque about the Sun, so the planet's angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is inversely as the square of the distance from that particle. For two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing the motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow Kepler’s laws and thus require a centripetal force that is inversely proportional to the square of their distance from the center. Newton further explains that the total gravitational force from a planet is the sum of the forces from all its parts, each following the inverse square law, and this holds true both for large distances and, with good approximation, near the planet’s surface.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies—planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter—demonstrating a universal principle of attraction.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these forces results in complex, perturbed motions rather than simple two-body ellipses.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and the concept of "fluxions" (his term for derivatives) as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the ancient mathematicians' methods, and regretted not studying Euclid more closely before algebraic writers. Additionally, he was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings and avoided controversy, which contributed to his choice of geometric presentation over the newer calculus notation.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force, directed toward the center of the orbit, constantly changes the direction of the body's velocity, keeping it in orbit. In the case of planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, causing the planet to follow an elliptical path around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in media like air or fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the medium and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones, even if their densities are equal. In sufficiently fluid media, such as air, water, and certain oils, resistance is primarily determined by density and velocity squared. He also distinguishes three sources of resistance in fluids: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. Newton analyzes how these resistances affect motion, provides methods to calculate resistance for different shapes, and confirms his theory with pendulum experiments.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and does not depend on the presence or motion of objects; absolute time flows uniformly regardless of events. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other or to a chosen reference frame.

This distinction supports Newton's laws by providing a universal framework: Newton's first law (inertia) and second law (F=ma) require a fixed, absolute reference to define true motion and acceleration, not just motion relative to other bodies. Absolute space and time ensure that the laws of motion are consistent and universally applicable, not dependent on arbitrary or changing frames of reference.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. Based on the policy's eligibility and addition clauses, the process to add a newly-adopted child is as follows:

The policyholder must submit a written application to the insurer to add the child. If the application is accepted, the policyholder must pay an additional premium on a pro-rata basis for the remainder of the policy period. The insurer will then issue a written endorsement confirming the child's addition to the policy.

The insurer may refuse to cover the child under the following circumstances:

*   **Eligibility:** The child, who is between 91 days and 18 years old, can only be covered if at least one parent is concurrently covered under the policy. If the parent is not covered, the child is not eligible.
*   **Addition Process:** The policy's "Additions" clause specifically lists "Newly appointed employee," "Newly wedded spouse," and "New born child" as categories for mid-term additions. Since an adopted child does not fall into these specific categories, the insurer may refuse a mid-term addition and require the policyholder to wait until the policy renewal period to add the child.
*   **Procedural Failure:** The insurer can refuse if the policyholder fails to pay the required additional pro-rata premium or does not complete the necessary application for the endorsement.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. Since the complication occurred within 45 days of the initial procedure, it is considered a relapse and treated as part of the same claim.

### **Claim Process**

1.  **Notification to TPA:**
    *   **For the planned Day Care Cataract Procedure:** You must notify the TPA at least 48 hours prior to the hospital admission.
    *   **For the Emergency Inpatient Care:** You must notify the TPA within 24 hours of admission or before discharge, whichever is earlier.

2.  **Payment at Hospital:**
    *   Since the inpatient care for complications was at a non-network hospital, you must pay all hospital bills upfront and then file for reimbursement.

3.  **Claim Submission:**
    *   You must submit the reimbursement claim documents for both the day care procedure and the subsequent inpatient stay to the TPA.
    *   **Timeline:** The documents must be submitted within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of discharge from the 5-day inpatient hospitalization.

### **Required Documents for Reimbursement**

*   MLC / FIR copy in Accidental cases only;
*   Copy of death summary and copy of death certificate (in death claims only);
*   Pre and post-operative imaging reports;
*   Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history of the Insured Person, treatment details and the Insured Person's progress;

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. Based on the policy terms, the newborn's treatment expenses are eligible for a claim.

The "Other Special Condition Details" on page 4 explicitly state, "**Baby Covered from Day 1 within Family Sum Insured**." This provision ensures that medical expenses incurred for the newborn, including intensive care, are covered from the moment of birth under the family's total sum insured.

The policy defines a "New Born Baby" as a baby aged up to 90 days. The fact that the baby expired within 24 hours does not negate the coverage for the treatment provided during that time. The claim for the newborn's intensive care expenses would be admissible under the family's floater sum insured.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient.

According to the policy, a **Psychiatrist** is defined as a medical practitioner holding a post-graduate degree or diploma in psychiatry (Page 21, Definition 34). A general practitioner does not meet this specific qualification for prescribing treatment for a psychiatric illness.

While a discharge summary from a **Clinical Psychologist** is acceptable, as they are recognized under the definition of a "Mental Healthcare Professional" (Page 21, Definition 27), the prescription must come from the appropriate specialist, which in this case is a Psychiatrist.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. Based on the annexures provided:

*   **ECG Electrodes:** These are payable with the constraint that "Up to 5 electrodes are required for every case visiting OT or ICU. For longer stay in ICU, may require a change and at least one set every second day is payable."
*   **Gloves:** Sterilized gloves are payable, but unsterilized gloves are not payable.

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Based on the policy, both pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed, subject to certain conditions.

**Pre-hospitalization Expenses:**
The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses for up to **30 days** before the date of admission. Since the expenses occurred 18 days before admission, they fall within this period and can be claimed.

**Post-hospitalization Expenses:**
The policy covers post-hospitalization medical expenses, including diagnostics and pharmacy costs, for up to **60 days** after the date of discharge. As the infection-related expenses were incurred 20 days after discharge, they are within the covered period and can be claimed.

**Conditions for Claiming:**
For both types of expenses, the following conditions must be met:
*   The claim for the in-patient hospitalization must be admissible and accepted by the insurance company.
*   The pre- and post-hospitalization expenses must be for the same illness or injury for which the person was hospitalized.

**Claim Submission Deadline:**
*   Documents for reimbursement of pre-hospitalization expenses must be submitted within **15 days** of the discharge date from the hospital.
*   Documents for reimbursement of post-hospitalization expenses must be submitted within **15 days** from the completion of the post-hospitalization treatment.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. According to the policy, a dependent child is eligible for coverage up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.

When a dependent insured person ceases to be a Dependent (for instance, by turning 27), their coverage ends. However, the policy allows for a specific agreement to be made for the coverage to continue until the end of the policy period.

In a similar context, such as the death of an employee, the policy states that their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. This indicates that coverage can extend to the policy's end date even after an event that changes eligibility.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. According to the Proportionate Clause (Note 1 under Clause III.A.1. In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover), if an insured person is admitted to a room with a rent exceeding the policy limit, the reimbursement for all associated medical expenses will be handled as follows:

The reimbursement/payment of all associated medical expenses incurred at the Hospital shall be effected in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of Room Rent.

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. If a claim is partly rejected due to a lack of required documentation, the insurer will inform the insured of the deficiency. If the necessary documents are not submitted within 10 working days of the first notification, the insurer will send up to three reminders.

Should the claim be finally rejected after the resubmission of documents, the insurer must provide a written explanation for the rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents.

To contest this final rejection, the insured person has the following course of action:

1.  **Request for Reconsideration:** Within 15 days of receiving the rejection notice, the insured may ask the insurer to reconsider the decision.
2.  **Grievance Redressal:** If unsatisfied with the outcome of the reconsideration, the insured can contact the company's grievance redressal channels:
    *   **Website:** www.uiic.co.in
    *   **Toll-free:** 1800 425 333 33
    *   **E-mail:** customercare@uiic.co.in
    *   **Courier:** Customer Care Department, Head Office, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014
    *   **In-person:** Approach the grievance cell at any of the company's branches.
3.  **Escalate to Grievance Officer:** If the issue remains unresolved, the insured can contact the grievance officer at customercare@uiic.co.in.
4.  **Approach the Insurance Ombudsman:** If still not satisfied, the insured may approach the office of the Insurance Ombudsman for their respective region.
5.  **Lodge a Complaint with IRDAI:** A grievance can also be filed with the IRDAI Integrated Grievance Management System at https://igms.irda.gov.in/.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the **Day Care Treatment** category.

The requirements for Day Care Treatment are:
i. undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement, and
ii. which would have otherwise required a hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. For a hospital to qualify under the policy, it must meet several minimum criteria. The requirements differ based on the population of the town where the hospital is located.

**In towns with a population of less than 10,00,000 (1 million):**
*   Must have at least **10 in-patient beds**.
*   Must have qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock.
*   Must have qualified medical practitioner(s) in charge round the clock.
*   Must have a fully equipped operation theatre of its own where surgical procedures are carried out.
*   Must maintain daily records of patients and make them accessible to the insurance company's authorized personnel.

**In all other places (including metropolitan areas with a population of 1 million or more):**
*   The requirements are the same, except the hospital must have at least **15 in-patient beds**.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A16. Based on the provided policy, here are the eligibility criteria and the process for the requested additions:

**Eligibility Criteria:**

*   **New Employee:** Must be a newly appointed employee of the policyholder.
*   **Spouse:** Must be the employee's legal spouse or life partner.
*   **Sibling:** Must be the employee's sibling, under the age of 26, and must be unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.

**Process and Documentation:**

The policyholder must submit a written request for the additions. The process requires the following:
1.  The application for cover must be accepted by the insurance company.
2.  An additional premium must be paid on a pro-rata basis for the new members.
3.  The underwriter will assess the request and may ask for additional information or documents.
4.  Once approved, the insurance company will issue an endorsement confirming the addition of the new members to the policy.

Q17. Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A17. Robotic surgery for malignancies (cancer) is covered whether performed as an inpatient or as a day care procedure. The policy states that expenses for modern treatments are covered "either as in-patient or as part of day care treatment in a hospital."

The applicable sub-limit, as specified in the "Other Special Conditions" of the policy schedule, is a restriction to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI) for the 12 modern treatments as per IRDAI, which includes robotic surgery.

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. For an emergency air ambulance evacuation and subsequent inpatient admission, you must follow these steps for pre-authorization and claims:

### **Pre-Authorization and Evacuation Steps**

1.  **Immediate Notification:** In the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, you must notify the insurer immediately, either by contacting their call center or in writing.
2.  **Mandatory Pre-authorization:** All emergency medical evacuations must be pre-authorized by the insurer.
3.  **Medical Necessity Assessment:** The insurer's team of specialists, in association with the emergency assistance service provider, will determine the medical necessity of the evacuation. The evacuation will only be approved after this assessment.
4.  **Hospital Admission:** For cashless inpatient admission at a network hospital, you must produce the ID card issued by the TPA at the hospital's insurance desk and complete the cashless request form for TPA pre-authorization.

### **Claims Assessment and Required Documentation**

For the claim to be assessed and settled, you must submit the following documents:

*   **For the Air Ambulance:**
    *   Air ambulance ticket for registered service provider.

*   **For the Inpatient Admission:**
    *   Duly completed claim form;
    *   Photo ID and Age proof;
    *   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;
    *   Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.
    *   Medical history of the patient as recorded (All previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for current ailment), bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner/ hospital
    *   Discharge certificate/ summary from the hospital.
    *   Photo ID and Age proof;

    *   All original medicine / pharmacy bills along with the Medical Practitioner's prescription;
    *   MLC / FIR copy in Accidental cases only;
    *   Copy of death summary and copy of death certificate (in death claims only);
    *   Pre and post-operative imaging reports;
    *   Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history of the Insured Person, treatment details and the Insured Person's progress;

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If the Insured Person is continuously covered without any break as defined under the applicable norms on portability stipulated by IRDAI, then the waiting period for a specific illness like knee replacement due to osteoarthritis would be reduced to the extent of the prior coverage. This exclusion applies to a list of specific diseases and procedures, including "Knee Replacement Surgery (other than caused by an Accident), Non-infectious Arthritis, Gout, Rheumatism, Osteoarthritis and Osteoporosis."

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. Based on the policy documents, coverage for an imported medication depends on whether it meets the criteria for "Medically Necessary Treatment" and is not classified as "Unproven/Experimental Treatment."

According to the policy:

*   **Medically Necessary Treatment** is defined as treatment that, among other criteria, "must conform to the professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India." (Page 20, Definition 27)
*   **Unproven/Experimental Treatment** is defined as "treatment, including drug experimental therapy, which is not based on established medical practice in India, is treatment experimental or unproven." (Page 20, Definition 43)
*   The policy explicitly excludes expenses for **Unproven Treatments**, which are defined as those that "lack significant medical documentation to support their effectiveness." (Page 25, Clause 16)

Therefore, the expense for the imported medication may be covered if it is part of a professional standard widely accepted in international medical practice and has significant medical documentation to support its use. However, if it is considered experimental or not based on established medical practice in India, it will be excluded from coverage.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. Model returned an empty answer.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. For claims involving implanted devices, the required documentation is the "Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery;".

If there is a deficiency in the necessary claim documents, such as providing only a generic invoice without an implant sticker, the company may, at its sole discretion, deduct the amount of the claim for which the deficiency is noted and settle the rest of the claim if it is otherwise valid.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges are covered if the service is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to provide expert nursing services at the patient's home immediately after hospital treatment. The services must be required by medical necessity and recommended by the Specialist who treated the patient.

For reimbursement, you will need to submit bills from the registered nursing service provider.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. In a multi-policy scenario where the primary policy's coverage is less than the admissible claim amount, the following procedure applies:

**Procedure and Coordination:**
The primary Insurer will seek the details of other available policies from the policyholder and will coordinate with the other Insurers to settle the balance amount. This is contingent upon the Insured Person submitting a written request for this coordination.

**Required Documentation:**
If the original documents have been submitted to the other insurer, the company may accept the following:
*   Duly certified documents as listed under clause VI.5.1.
*   Claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. No, these expenses are not claimable.

According to the policy's exclusions, specifically under **Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04)**, "Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded."

Furthermore, the policy defines **Hospitalisation** as requiring **Inpatient Care**, which in turn is defined as receiving **Treatment**. A specific exclusion also states that "Any stay in Hospital without undertaking any Treatment" is not covered. Since the hospitalization was solely for evaluation and no treatment was administered, the associated costs are excluded from coverage.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. In the event of the policyholder's death where there is no subsisting nominee, the company will pay the claim amount to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. The legal heir must provide a succession certificate or an indemnity bond, whichever is available, to receive the payment. This payment will be considered a full and final discharge of the company's liability under the policy.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Based on the policy's exclusions, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered in the following scenarios:

*   **Not Required During Surgery:** Prostheses, corrective devices, and/or Medical Appliances that are not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the person was hospitalized are excluded.
*   **External Devices:** Specific external devices such as an infusion pump, Oxygen Concentrator for Bronchial Asthmatic condition, or instrument used in the treatment of Sleep Apnea Syndrome (C.P.A.P.) are not covered.
*   **Home Use and Personal Comfort:** Expenses for items considered non-medical or for personal comfort are not covered, even if they are medical equipment subsequently used at home. This includes:
    *   Ambulatory devices
    *   Walker, crutches
    *   Belts, collars, splints, slings, braces
    *   Stockings of any kind
    *   Diabetic footwear
    *   Glucometer/thermometer
*   **Specific Items Listed as "Not Payable":** The policy annexure explicitly lists several appliances as not payable, including:
    *   Walking aids
    *   Oxygen cylinder for usage outside the hospital
    *   Spacer
    *   Nebulizer kit
    *   Armsling
    *   Cervical collar
    *   Splint
    *   Diabetic foot wear
    *   Knee braces (long/short/hinged)
    *   Knee immobilizer/shoulder immobilizer
    *   Lumbo sacral belt
    *   Ambulance collar

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. No, the expenses will not be reimbursed.

The policy specifies that AYUSH treatment is covered only in Government Recognised hospitals that are NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) approved. Furthermore, the policy's general definition of a "Hospital" requires it to be registered with the local authorities. An unregistered facility does not meet these criteria, so expenses incurred there would not be covered, even if it has qualified practitioners.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. In the event of any change in the diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost of treatment during hospitalization, the Network Provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer/TPA.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. According to the policy, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after a decision has been made on the main Hospitalisation claim.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A31. Based on the document, the policyholder's contact details are:

**Insured:** M/s DATA SOLUTIONS INDIA
**Address:** 4TH FLOOR, 1, BLOCK A, DLF INDUSTRIAL AREA, SECTOR 32, FARIDABAD HARYANA 121003, ΗΥΡΑ AXIS BANK LTD FARIDABAD, FARIDABAD HARYANA 121003.

The document does not provide a telephone number, fax, or email address for the policyholder.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Answer not present in documents

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. If any claim is found to be fraudulent, or if a false statement or declaration is used to support it, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid will be forfeited. Any amount already paid against a fraudulent claim must be repaid to the insurer.

For claims with missing documents (deficiency), the insurer will notify the claimant and send up to three reminders. If the deficiency is not resolved, the insurer may, at its discretion, deduct the amount related to the missing information and settle the rest of the claim if it is otherwise valid.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. Yes, you can receive reimbursement for non-hospitalization expenses, but only if you have opted for the "Out-Patient Cover," which is an optional benefit.

For this optional cover, the required documents for a claim are:
*   Invoices
*   Treating Medical Practitioner's prescription
*   Reports, duly signed by the Insured Person

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Based on the document, the policy's coverage is limited to India. The following specific exclusion applies:

*   **Treatment received outside India.**

The policy further clarifies this under the "Geographical Area" clause, stating: "The geographical scope of this Policy applies to events limited to India unless specified under this Policy in a particular Benefit or definition. However, all admitted or payable claims shall be settled in India in Indian rupees."

Q36. How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A36. I cannot fulfill this request. Providing information on how to commit fraudulent activities is illegal and unethical. My purpose is to provide helpful and harmless assistance, which includes upholding the law and ethical standards.

1.  Check the list of network hospitals available on the official website: **www.orientalinsurance.org.in**.
2.  Request the list from the concerned Third Party Administrator (TPA).

### **3. Sibling Dependency and Coverage**

According to section 2.13 D of the policy, coverage for a sibling is based on two conditions: they must be **unmarried** and **financially dependent**. The policy does not specify an age limit for dependent siblings. Therefore, a sibling over 26 who is unmarried and has become financially dependent can be covered under the policy.

Q3. While inquiring about the maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law, simultaneously provide the claim notification procedure, and confirm the process to replace a lost ID card for another dependent.
A3. The maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law is up to the Sum Insured of your chosen policy plan (Silver, Gold, Diamond, or Platinum), subject to the sub-limits specified for expenses like room rent, ICU charges, and surgeon's fees.

The claim notification procedure is as follows:

Immediate notice of a claim must be given to the Company/TPA via fax or e-mail while the insured person is undergoing treatment. This notice should be provided within 48 hours of admission and before discharge. The notification must include:

Q4. If you wish to admit your 17-year-old son for psychiatric illness to a hospital outside your city, also request an address update for all family members, and inquire about coverage for OPD dental checkups under Gold and Platinum plans.
A4. Model returned an empty answer.

A6. Based on the policy document, here are the answers to your questions:

*   **Caesarean Delivery at a Non-Network Hospital:** Medical expenses for a caesarean delivery are covered under the Diamond and Platinum Plans, provided the policy has been in continuous force for at least 24 months for both the insured and their spouse.
