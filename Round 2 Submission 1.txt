--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Quantity of motion is defined as the measure arising from the velocity multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass) in a body. It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body, and for a body with double the mass at equal velocity, the quantity of motion is doubled; with twice the velocity, it is quadrupled. In contrast, force (specifically motive force) arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. Thus, quantity of motion refers to momentum (mass × velocity), while force refers to the product of mass and acceleration.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies the effect of gravitational force on planetary acceleration. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies, ensuring that forces between two bodies are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law—equal areas in equal times—using his laws of motion and universal gravitation. The gravitational force between the Sun and a planet acts along the line joining them, making it a central force. Central forces produce zero torque about the center, so the planet's angular momentum about the Sun is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum ensures that the radius vector from the Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time, which is Kepler's Second Law.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship holds for the total gravitational force, which is compounded from the forces of gravity towards all parts of a mass, each following the inverse square law. The periodic times of orbiting bodies, such as moons, also confirm this law, as their centripetal forces are reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the central body. Thus, Newton establishes that gravitational force decreases in proportion to the square of the distance between the centers of two masses.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, all planets towards one another, and comets towards the sun. This mutual gravitation applies to every particle of matter, with the force of gravity between two bodies being proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Therefore, all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation, and gravity acts universally on all masses.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these forces results in complex, time-dependent variations in each planet’s trajectory, known as orbital perturbations.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and the concept of "fluxions" as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the demonstration methods of the ancients, and regretted not studying Euclid more closely at the start of his mathematical studies. Newton also avoided publishing his purely mathematical writings voluntarily due to his aversion to controversy and dispute.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in media such as air or fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the medium and the square of the velocity of the body. He distinguishes between different types of resistance—arising from the inactivity of the fluid, the tenacity of its parts, or friction. In sufficiently fluid media, resistance is primarily determined by density and velocity, with more tenacious fluids resisting more than less viscous ones of equal density. Newton also provides methods to calculate the resistance for various shapes and confirms the theory through experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the immovable stage on which all physical events occur, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of external factors. Relative motion, in contrast, describes the movement of objects only in relation to other objects, lacking a universal reference.

Newton's laws, especially the first law (law of inertia), require a fixed reference frame to define true rest and uniform motion. Absolute space and time provide this universal framework, allowing Newton's laws to be applied consistently and distinguishing true motion from merely relative motion between bodies.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Robert Newton and James Ayscough.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. Newton never married and had no children, so no direct descendants exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?
A1. Expenses for arthritis treatment at home would NOT be covered if:

- The treatment involves non-medical expenses such as ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings, diabetic footwear, glucometer/thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home, except when they form part of room expenses.
- The treatment is received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments, or private beds registered as a nursing home.
- The treatment is for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, or any addictive condition and consequences thereof.
- The treatment is provided by a hospital, Medical Practitioner, or provider specifically excluded by the insurer and disclosed on its website or notified to policyholders, except in life-threatening situations or following an accident, where only expenses up to stabilization are payable.
- The expenses exceed the opted deductible, co-payment, or sub-limit as specified in the policy.
- The charges are more than what other hospitals or doctors in the same locality would have charged for the same medical treatment.

Q2. A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?
A2. Payable items:
- Prosthetic device (implanted during hip replacement surgery)

Not payable:
- Walker (not payable)

Q3. An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A3. The insured's child, being above 18 but under 26, unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, is eligible for coverage. Dental surgery expenses are admissible if the treatment is for reconstruction following an accident, as exclusions for cosmetic or plastic surgery do not apply in such medically necessary cases. The attending Medical Practitioner must certify the medical necessity.

Claim process:
- Submit the claim form along with invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports, duly signed by the insured person, to the insurer's branch or head office.
- The insurer will assess the claim documents and determine admissibility.
- The claim will be settled or repudiated within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document.

Required documents: Claim form, invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, reports, and certification of medical necessity for reconstruction after accident.

Q4. If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A4. Expenses for Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period for claims involving IONM, as per the modern treatment methods list.

ICU charges, including ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges, are covered up to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI) per day (inclusive of nursing charges) as specified in the special conditions. If the insured is admitted in a higher category than eligible, the insured will bear the difference of all medical expenses in the same proportion as in the final hospital bill.

Both expenses are subject to the respective limits in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance and the proportionate clause applies if room category exceeds eligibility.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. To add a newly-adopted 3-year-old child as a dependent, the policyholder must submit a written application for cover. The insurer will assess the application, and coverage will be effective upon acceptance, receipt of the pro-rata premium for the risk coverage duration, and issuance of an endorsement confirming the addition.

The insurer may refuse cover if:
- The application for cover is not accepted.
- The required additional premium is not received.
- The policyholder fails to notify the insurer within the stipulated time (on or before the last day of the month following the addition).
- The child does not meet eligibility criteria as specified in the policy (e.g., if the policy restricts coverage to biological or stepchildren only, or if the relationship is not specified in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance).
- The minimum group size requirement is not maintained.

All endorsement requests are subject to underwriter assessment, and additional information or documents may be requested. Coverage is not effective until all requirements are fulfilled and the insurer issues an endorsement.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. For the day care cataract procedure:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior in case of planned hospitalisation.
- If using the cashless facility, submit required documents immediately after discharge.
- If claiming reimbursement, submit documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

For the subsequent inpatient hospitalisation due to complications in a non-network hospital:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior in case of planned hospitalisation.
- Submit reimbursement claim documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

For both events, required documents must be submitted as per the timelines above. For post-hospitalisation expenses, submit documents within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment.

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. The newborn is eligible for cover from birth if maternity cover is opted and the insurer is notified in writing on or before the last day of the month following the birth, with the agreed premium paid. However, claim eligibility for the newborn’s treatment expenses is subject to the following:

- The newborn must be accepted as an insured person as per the New Born Baby Benefit Cover terms.
- Medical treatment expenses for the newborn, including intensive care, are covered if the above notification and premium requirements are met.
- The newborn is defined as a baby born during the policy period and aged up to 90 days.
- Exclusions do not apply to the newborn’s treatment unless specifically stated; expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) are excluded for the mother, not the newborn.
- The claim for the newborn’s treatment must be submitted with all required documents for assessment.

Therefore, if the newborn was notified and the premium paid as required, the newborn’s intensive care treatment expenses are eligible for claim under the policy. If notification or premium requirements are not met, the claim for the newborn’s treatment expenses is not eligible.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient. The required claim documents for inpatient psychiatric treatment include:

- Attending medical practitioner's/surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports, etc., supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.
- Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.
- All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) along with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice/bill with receipt from diagnostic center.
- Medical history of the patient as recorded (all previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for current ailment), bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner/hospital.
- Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents.
- Original final hospital bill with detailed break-up with all original deposit and final payment receipt.
- Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history, treatment details, and progress.

Additionally, the definition of Medical Practitioner requires a valid registration from the Medical Council of any State or the Medical Council of India. A Clinical Psychologist is not recognized as a Medical Practitioner under these rules. Therefore, a discharge summary certified only by a Clinical Psychologist does not meet the requirement. The prescription and discharge summary must be issued and certified by a registered Medical Practitioner (psychiatrist or physician with valid medical registration).

In summary, both the prescription and discharge summary must be from a registered Medical Practitioner, not solely from a Clinical Psych

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. ECG electrodes are admissible up to 5 electrodes per case visiting OT or ICU. For longer ICU stays, at least one set every second day is payable. Gloves are not listed as payable items and are not admissible for reimbursement.

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Pre-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred 18 days before admission for the same illness can be claimed, provided they fall within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is admissible.

Post-hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge for the same illness can be claimed, provided they are within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is admissible.

Both pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses must relate to the same illness or injury for which hospitalisation was required, and claims are subject to the policy’s specified time limits and amount limits.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. Coverage for a dependent child ends when they cease to meet the eligibility criteria, which is upon turning 27 years old. Even if the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, the child is no longer eligible as a dependent from their 27th birthday. As per deletion protocols, the dependent child must be deleted from the policy effective from the date they turn 27. Any refund of premium for the remaining period is made on a pro-rata basis, provided no claim is paid or outstanding for that dependent. Coverage does not continue until the end of the policy year; it terminates on the dependent’s 27th birthday.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. Associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, are reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rent per day bears to the actual room rent per day, as per the Proportionate Clause. This proportionate deduction applies because the insured opted for a room exceeding the allowed limit and the hospital follows differential billing. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause for Clause III.A.1.A.

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation and the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, the company may have already sent up to three reminders regarding the deficiency. The company can, at its discretion, deduct the amount related to the deficiency and settle the rest of the claim if otherwise valid.

If the company decides to reject the claim, it must communicate the rejection in writing, explicitly stating the grounds for rejection, within 15 days from receipt of the final documents or investigation report. Upon receiving the rejection, the insured person has 15 days from the date of receipt of the claims decision to represent to the company for reconsideration.

If the claim is rejected or partially settled and is not the subject of any pending suit or other proceeding within twelve months from the date of such rejection or settlement, the claim is deemed abandoned and the company's liability is extinguished.

If there is a delay in claim payment beyond the stipulated period (15 days from receipt of last necessary document, or 45 days if investigation is required), the company must pay interest at 2% above the bank rate from the date of receipt of last necessary document to the date of payment.

For grievance redressal, the insured may follow the company's grievance procedures as outlined in the policy.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the "Day Care Treatment" category.

Requirements:
- The procedure is undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement.
- The procedure would have otherwise required hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.
- Treatment normally taken on an out-patient basis is not covered.

Since the insured person was hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia, and the procedure previously required more than 24 hours, it meets the criteria for Day Care Treatment.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. In towns with a population of less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. In metropolitan areas (towns with a population of 10,00,000 or more), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. The difference is the minimum number of in-patient beds required: 10 in smaller towns and 15 in metropolitan areas.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?

For claims involving malignancies (cancer), the coverage is subject to this specified limit. Additionally, for modern treatments as per IRDAI, including robotic surgeries for cancer, the sub-limit is restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI). This 50% SI sub-limit applies regardless of whether the procedure is done as day care or inpatient.

Pre-Authorization Steps:

- Notify the insurer or TPA at the call centre or in writing within 10 days from the date of the accident.
- Submit a pre-authorization request to the insurer/TPA with all relevant medical details.
- The TPA may request additional medical details; failure to provide these may result in denial of pre-authorization.

Claims Assessment Steps:

- Settle all non-admissible expenses, expenses above specified sub-limits, co-payments, and/or opted deductibles directly with the hospital.

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer and recently ported to this policy, the waiting period for a specific illness (such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) will be reduced to the extent of prior coverage, as per IRDAI guidelines on portability. The insured will receive accrued continuity benefits in waiting periods, provided there has been no break in coverage. If the sum insured is enhanced upon porting, the waiting period exclusion will apply afresh only to the increased amount.

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. The expense for an imported medication not normally used in India will not be covered if the treatment is considered experimental or unproven, as only treatments conforming to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India are covered. Coverage is limited to medically necessary treatments that are not experimental or unproven.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. For a non-employer group policy, if a member dies during the policy period, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period, at the option of the insured. Coverage for dependents continues as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?

- Duly completed claim form
- Photo ID and Age proof
- Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents

If only a generic invoice is provided without the implant sticker, the claim may be delayed or denied, as the original invoice with payment receipt and implant sticker is a mandatory requirement for claims involving implants.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement if:

- The insured person was hospitalised for an illness or injury during the policy period.
- The insurance company has accepted the inpatient hospitalisation claim for that illness or injury.
- The home nursing is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to provide expert nursing services immediately after discharge.
- The post-hospitalisation medical expenses, including home nursing, are incurred for the same condition as the hospitalisation.
- The expenses are within the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. If the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer will seek details of other available policies of the policyholder and coordinate with other Insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided a written request for the same has been submitted by the Insured Person. If original documents have been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified documents listed under clause VI.5.1 and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer, subject to the company's satisfaction.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. If the insured's hospitalization was solely for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, with no treatment provided, these expenses are not claimable. Diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are also excluded. Therefore, such hospitalization expenses are not admissible under the policy.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. Processing timed out for this question.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.

- When they are ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer, thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home, except when they form part of room expenses.
- When they are not medically necessary or not part of the recuperation process on a short-term basis.
- When they are for cosmetic or plastic surgery or any treatment to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk, certified by the attending medical practitioner.
- When they are for external congenital anomaly or defects.
- When they are not prescribed by a medical practitioner as part of a hospitalization claim or day care procedure.
- When they are not of a reasonable charge or not a medically necessary treatment.

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. Expenses will not be reimbursed because the AYUSH hospital must be registered with local authorities to be eligible for claim reimbursement, regardless of having qualified practitioners. Registration is a mandatory criterion.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. The hospital/provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA for the revised treatment plan and higher estimate, following the prescribed process. This ensures continued cashless eligibility for the insured.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. The pre-hospitalisation medical expenses claim will be processed only after the main hospitalisation claim has been decided. If a claim for pre-hospitalisation expenses is submitted before approval of the main inpatient hospitalisation claim, it will not be processed until the main claim decision is made.

A31. The policyholder's contact details are not provided in the document.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Claims cannot be approved automatically.

Any deficiencies must be addressed, and claims are processed only after these steps are completed. Automatic approval is not permitted under the defined process.

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. If a claim has missing documents, the deficiency will be intimated to the Insured Person or Network Provider, and up to three reminders will be sent. If the deficiency is not rectified within the specified period, the insurer may deduct the amount related to the deficiency and settle the valid part of the claim.

If a claim is supported by forged or fraudulent documents, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid will be forfeited. Any amount already paid against such claims must be repaid by all recipients or policyholders, who are jointly and severally liable. The insurer will not repudiate the claim or forfeit benefits on the ground of fraud if the Insured Person or beneficiary can prove the misstatement was unintentional and not deliberate.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. No, reimbursement is not provided for expenses not related to hospitalization. Only post-hospitalisation medical expenses directly related to an accepted in-patient hospitalisation claim for the same illness or injury are covered, subject to policy terms and exclusions. Expenses for diagnostics, evaluation, or treatments unrelated to the hospitalization are excluded.

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide include:

- Treatment in any hospital or by any Medical Practitioner or provider specifically excluded by the Insurer and disclosed on its website/notified to policyholders (except for life-threatening situations or following an accident, where expenses up to stabilization are payable but not the complete claim)
