Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to

looked  upon."J 
Though  Newton  had  continued  silent,  yet  his  thoughts  were 
by  no  means  inactive  upon  the  vast  subject  of  the  planetary  mo 
tions.  The  idea  of  Universal  Gravitation,  first  caught  sight  of,  so
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra
that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
To  determine  the  motions  of  two  bodies  attracting  each  other  with  forces 
reciprocally  proportional  to  the  squares  of  their  distance,  and  going
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
sphere  is  attracted  with  a  force  reciprocally  proportional  to  the  square 
of  its  distance  from  the  centre.
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.
However,  it  was  agreed  on  both  sides  that  the  motions  of  the  celestial
we  in  the  third  derive  from  the  celestial  phenomena  the  forces  of  gravity 
with  which  bodies  tend  to  the  sun  and  the  several  planets.  Then  from  these

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac 
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after 
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the 
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of 
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others 
have  greatly  contributed  to  display  the  most  hidden  treasures  of 
the  PRINCIPIA.

directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic

circumsaturnal  about  Saturn,  and  of  Mercury  and  Venus,  and  the  other 
circumsolar  planets,  about  the  sun,  are  appearances  of  the  same  sort  with 
the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same 
proportion,  and  according  to  the  same  law,  as  the  force  of  gravity  does  in 
receding  from  the  earth.

with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re

gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the

if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known

IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and

For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic

circumsolar  planets,  about  the  sun,  are  appearances  of  the  same  sort  with 
the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same 
proportion,  and  according  to  the  same  law,  as  the  force  of  gravity  does  in 
receding  from  the  earth.

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta

tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
let  fall  at  equal  distances  from  the  sun,  they  would,  in  their  descent  towards 
the  sun,  describe  equal  spaces  in  equal  times.  But  forces  which  equally 
accelerate  unequal  bodies  must  be  as  those  bodies  :  that  is  to  sa_y,  the  weights 
;f  the  planets  towards  the  sun  must  be  as  their  quantities  of  matter, 
further,  that  the  weights  of  Jupiter  and  of  his  satellites  towards  the  sun 
are  proportional  to  the  several  quantities  of  their  matter,  appears  from  the 
exceedingly  regular  motions  of  the  satellites  (by  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXV,  Book 
1).  For  if  some  of  those  bodies  were  more  strongly  attracted  to  the  sun  in 
proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter  than  others,  the  motions  of  the  sat

vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the

conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they

As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the

Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa

equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate

as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans

scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo

with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re

gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen

remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with

Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of

directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic

circumsolar  planets,  about  the  sun,  are  appearances  of  the  same  sort  with 
the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same 
proportion,  and  according  to  the  same  law,  as  the  force  of  gravity  does  in

IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex

the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of

upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself

of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
There  is  not,  in  fact,  the  least  evidence  that  Newton's  reason  was, 
for  a  single  moment,  dethroned  ;  on  the  contrary,  the  testimony

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math

scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo

with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole

Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must

as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir,

from  the  laws  of  motion,  it  is  most  certain  that  these  effects  must  proceed 
from  the  action  of  some  force  or  other.
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
tive  to  the  accomplishment  of  that  end  as  the  study  of  Geometri 
cal  Synthesis  ?  The  Calculus,  in  some  shape  or  other,  is,  indeed, 
necessary  to  the  successful  prosecution  of  researches  in  the  higher 
branches  of  philosophy.  But  has  not  the  Analytical  encroached 
upon  the  Synthetical,  and  Algorithmic  Formulae  been  employed 
when  not  requisite,  either  for  the  evolution  of  truth,  or  even  its 
apter  illustration  ?  To  each  method  belongs,  undoubtedly,  an 
appropriate  use.  Newton,  himself  the  inventor  of  Fluxions, 
censured  the  handling  of  Geometrical  subjects  by  Algebraical 
calculations  ;  and  the  maturest  opinions  which  he  expressed  were 
additionally  in  favour  of  the  Geometrical  Method.  His  prefer 
ence,  so  strongly  marked,  is  not  to  be  reckoned  a  mere  matter  oi

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

circumsolar  planets,  about  the  sun,  are  appearances  of  the  same  sort  with 
the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same 
proportion,  and  according  to  the  same  law,  as  the  force  of  gravity  does  in 
receding  from  the  earth.

Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter

similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

tive  force  varying  inversely  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  will 
describe  an  elliptical  orbit,  in  one  of  whose  foci  the  attractive 
force  resides.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to
perimental  philosophy.  In  this  philosophy  particular  propositions  are 
inferred  from  the  phenomena,  and  afterwards  rendered  general  by  induc 
tion.  Thus  it  was  that  the  impenetrability,  the  mobility,  and  the  impul 
sive  force  of  bodies,  and  the  laws  of  motion  and  of  gravitation,  were 
discovered.  And  to  us  it  is  enough  that  gravity  does  really  exist,  and  act 
according  to  the  laws  which  we  have  explained,  and  abundantly  serves  to 
account  for  all  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies,  and  of  our  sea.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de

with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re

upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole

to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the

therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it

exceedingly  regular  motions  of  the  satellites  (by  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXV,  Book 
1).  For  if  some  of  those  bodies  were  more  strongly  attracted  to  the  sun  in

If  two  bodies  S  and  P,  attracting  each  other  with  forces  reciprocally  pro 
portional  to  the  squares  of  their  distance,  revolve  about  their  common 
centre  of  gravity  ;  I  say,  that  the  principal  axis  of  the  ellipsis  which 
either  of  the  bodies,  as  P,  describes  by  this  motion  about  the  other  S, 
will  be  to  the  principal  axis  of  the  ellipsis,  which  the  same  body  P  may 
describe  in  the  same  periodical  time  about  the  other  body  S  quiescent, 
as  the  sum  of  the  two  bodies  S  +  P  to  the  first  of  two  mean,  propor

For  if  the  ellipses  described  were  equal  to  each  other,  their  periodic  times

themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev

Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa

equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate

as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method

space  will  be  given  from  the  given  time :  and  the  contrary.

of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis

the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in

Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
The  later  philosophers  pretend  to  account  for  it  either  by  the  action  of 
certain  vortices,  as  Kepler  and  Des  Cartes  ;  or  by  some  other  principle  of 
impulse  or  attraction,  as  Borelli,  Honke,  and  others  of  our  nation  ;  for, 
from  the  laws  of  motion,  it  is  most  certain  that  these  effects  must  proceed 
from  the  action  of  some  force  or  other.
or  change  the  velocity  of  the  body  in  that  path,  but  only  draw  it  aside 
from  a  rectilinear  course,  and  make  it  deflect  perpetually  from  the  tangent 
of  the  orbit,  and  proceed  in  the  curvilinear  path  ITK/j.  That  whole 
force,  therefore,  will  be  spent  in  producing  this  effect:  but  the  other  force 
IT,  acting  in  the  direction  of  the  course  of  the  body,  will  be  all  employed 
in  accelerating  it,  and  in  the  least  given  time  will  produce  an  acceleration 
proportional  to  itself.  Therefore  the  accelerations  of  the  bodies  in  D  and 
I,  produced  in  equal  times,  are  as  the  lines  DE,  IT  (if  we  take  the  first 
ratios  of  the  nascent  lines  DE,  IN,  IK,  IT,  NT) ;  and  in  unequal  times  as 
those  lines  and  the  times  conjunctly.  But  the  times  in  which  DE  and  IK 
are  described,  are,  by  reason  of  the  equal  velocities  (in  D  and  I)  as  the 
spaces  described  DE  and  IK,  and  therefore  the  accelerations  in  the  course 
of  the  bodies  through  the  lines  DE  and  IK  are  as  DE  and  IT,  and  DE 
and  IK  conjunctly ;  that  is,  as  the  square  of  DE  to  the  rectangle  IT  into 
IK.  But  the  rectangle  IT  X  IK  is  equal  to  the  square  of  IN,  that  is, 
equal  to  the  square  of  DE ;  and  therefore  the  accelerations  generated  in 
the  passage  of  the  bodies  from  D  and  I  to  E  and  K  are  equal.  Therefore 
the  velocities  of  the  holies  in  E  and  K  are  also  equal,  and  by  the  same 
reasoning  they  will  always  be  found  equal  in  any  subsequent  equal  dis 
tances.  Q..E.D.
This  proportion,  first  observed  by  Kepler,  is  now  received  by  all  astron

the  sun.  And  as  to  the  measures  of  the  periodic  times,  all  astronomers  are
let  fall  at  equal  distances  from  the  sun,  they  would,  in  their  descent  towards 
the  sun,  describe  equal  spaces  in  equal  times.  But  forces  which  equally 
accelerate  unequal  bodies  must  be  as  those  bodies  :  that  is  to  sa_y,  the  weights

further,  that  the  weights  of  Jupiter  and  of  his  satellites  towards  the  sun 
are  proportional  to  the  several  quantities  of  their  matter,  appears  from  the 
exceedingly  regular  motions  of  the  satellites  (by  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXV,  Book 
1).  For  if  some  of  those  bodies  were  more  strongly  attracted  to  the  sun  in 
proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter  than  others,  the  motions  of  the  sat

NEWTON'S  SYSTEM  OF  THE  WORLD ;
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
time,  and  (by  this  Prop.)  the  space  is  given  from  the  given  velocity ;  the 
space  will  be  given  from  the  given  time :  and  the  contrary.
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, 
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, 
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its 
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no 
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion 
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the 
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some 
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where 
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by 
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute 
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now 
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
NEWTON'S  SYSTEM  OF  THE  WORLD ;
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
COR,  1.  Therefore  the  force  of  gravity  towards  any  whole  planet  arises 
from,  and  is  compounded  of,  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its  parts. 
Magnetic  and  electric  attractions  afford  us  examples  of  this ;  for  all  at 
traction  towards  the  whole  arises  from  the  attractions  towards  the  several

There  is  not,  in  fact,  the  least  evidence  that  Newton's  reason  was, 
for  a  single  moment,  dethroned  ;  on  the  contrary,  the  testimony
If  the  attractive  forces  of  the  equal  particles  of  any  body  be  as  the  dis 
tance  of  the  places  from  the  particles,  the  force  of  the  whole  body  will 
tend  to  its  centre  of  gravity  ;  and  will  be  the  same  with  the  force  of

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac 
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after 
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the 
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of 
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others 
have  greatly  contributed  to  display  the  most  hidden  treasures  of 
the  PRINCIPIA.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other
And  thus  was  ushered  into  existence  The  PRINCIPIA — a  work
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex

Though  Newton  had  continued  silent,  yet  his  thoughts  were

the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon

the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same

That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

time,  and  (by  this  Prop.)  the  space  is  given  from  the  given  velocity ;  the 
space  will  be  given  from  the  given  time :  and  the  contrary.
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the

This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb,

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac 
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after 
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the 
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of 
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others 
have  greatly  contributed  to  display  the  most  hidden  treasures  of

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the

And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to

That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its

inferred  from  the  phenomena,  and  afterwards  rendered  general  by  induc 
tion.  Thus  it  was  that  the  impenetrability,  the  mobility,  and  the  impul 
sive  force  of  bodies,  and  the  laws  of  motion  and  of  gravitation,  were 
discovered.  And  to  us  it  is  enough  that  gravity  does  really  exist,  and  act 
according  to  the  laws  which  we  have  explained,  and  abundantly  serves  to 
account  for  all  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies,  and  of  our  sea.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which 
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen

Kepler.

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did

parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re

II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to
parts.  The  thing  may  be  easily  understood  in  gravity,  if  we  consider  a 
greater  planet,  as  formed  of  a  number  of  lesser  planets,  meeting  together  in 
one  globe ;  for  hence  it  would  appear  that  the  force  of  the  whole  must 
arise  from  the  forces  of  the  component  parts.  If  it  is  objected,  that,  ac 
cording  to  this  law,  all  bodies  with  us  must  mutually  gravitate  one  to 
wards  another,  whereas  no  such  gravitation  any  where  appears,  I  answer, 
that  since  the  gravitation  towards  these  bodies  is  to  the  gravitation  towards 
the  whole  earth  as  these  bodies  are  to  the  whole  earth,  the  gravitation  to 
wards  them  must  be  far  less  than  to  fall  under  the  observation  of  our  senses.
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
