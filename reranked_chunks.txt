Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to

looked  upon."J 
Though  Newton  had  continued  silent,  yet  his  thoughts  were 
by  no  means  inactive  upon  the  vast  subject  of  the  planetary  mo 
tions.  The  idea  of  Universal  Gravitation,  first  caught  sight  of,  so
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra
that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
To  determine  the  motions  of  two  bodies  attracting  each  other  with  forces 
reciprocally  proportional  to  the  squares  of  their  distance,  and  going
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
sphere  is  attracted  with  a  force  reciprocally  proportional  to  the  square 
of  its  distance  from  the  centre.
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler ‚Äî laws,  which

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac 
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after 
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the 
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of 
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others

the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis

demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same

with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re

upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole

to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the

stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon

circumsolar  planets,  about  the  sun,  are  appearances  of  the  same  sort  with 
the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same 
proportion,  and  according  to  the  same  law,  as  the  force  of  gravity  does  in 
receding  from  the  earth.

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the

versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta

tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler ‚Äî laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
let  fall  at  equal  distances  from  the  sun,  they  would,  in  their  descent  towards 
the  sun,  describe  equal  spaces  in  equal  times.  But  forces  which  equally 
accelerate  unequal  bodies  must  be  as  those  bodies  :  that  is  to  sa_y,  the  weights 
;f  the  planets  towards  the  sun  must  be  as  their  quantities  of  matter, 
further,  that  the  weights  of  Jupiter  and  of  his  satellites  towards  the  sun 
are  proportional  to  the  several  quantities  of  their  matter,  appears  from  the 
exceedingly  regular  motions  of  the  satellites  (by  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXV,  Book 
1).  For  if  some  of  those  bodies  were  more  strongly  attracted  to  the  sun  in 
proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter  than  others,  the  motions  of  the  sat

IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the

that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be

This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir,

Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate

as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen

Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other

directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon

circumsolar  planets,  about  the  sun,  are  appearances  of  the  same  sort  with 
the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same 
proportion,  and  according  to  the  same  law,  as  the  force  of  gravity  does  in

IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex

the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of

From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other

of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
There  is  not,  in  fact,  the  least  evidence  that  Newton's  reason  was, 
for  a  single  moment,  dethroned  ;  on  the  contrary,  the  testimony

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must

Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa

ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motions.  It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing 
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured.  All  mo
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

space  will  be  given  from  the  given  time :  and  the  contrary.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
The  later  philosophers  pretend  to  account  for  it  either  by  the  action  of 
certain  vortices,  as  Kepler  and  Des  Cartes  ;  or  by  some  other  principle  of 
impulse  or  attraction,  as  Borelli,  Honke,  and  others  of  our  nation  ;  for, 
from  the  laws  of  motion,  it  is  most  certain  that  these  effects  must  proceed 
from  the  action  of  some  force  or  other.
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
tive  to  the  accomplishment  of  that  end  as  the  study  of  Geometri 
cal  Synthesis  ?  The  Calculus,  in  some  shape  or  other,  is,  indeed, 
necessary  to  the  successful  prosecution  of  researches  in  the  higher 
branches  of  philosophy.  But  has  not  the  Analytical  encroached 
upon  the  Synthetical,  and  Algorithmic  Formulae  been  employed 
when  not  requisite,  either  for  the  evolution  of  truth,  or  even  its 
apter  illustration  ?  To  each  method  belongs,  undoubtedly,  an 
appropriate  use.  Newton,  himself  the  inventor  of  Fluxions, 
censured  the  handling  of  Geometrical  subjects  by  Algebraical 
calculations  ;  and  the  maturest  opinions  which  he  expressed  were 
additionally  in  favour  of  the  Geometrical  Method.  His  prefer 
ence,  so  strongly  marked,  is  not  to  be  reckoned  a  mere  matter  oi

upon  the  decision  of  every  instructor  in  adopting  what  may  be
