• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

Lubrication
• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

| WARNING
!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

• To drain the oil, remove the oil level dipstick 
(page 39) and drain bolt (1) with sealing 
washer (2).
• After the oil has completely drained, 
reinstall the drain bolt with a new sealing 
washer.
Oil circulation inspection
• Start the engine and allow it to idle for few 
minutes.
• Stop the engine, let the engine oil settle 
down and recheck the oil level.
• Make sure that oil level is at the “UPPER”
level mark of the oil level dipstick with the 
vehicle in an upright position and that there 
are no oil leaks.
• Remove the oil filter screen (9) and wash it 
in clean non flammable or high flash point 
solvent (kerosene).

Lubrication
• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

| --- | --- |
| Rear | 90/90-18 51P (Tubeless tyre) |
| WARNING
!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.
(c) Brake pad wear (Disc variant)
Brake pad wear depends upon the severity of 
usage, the type of riding & road conditions. 
Generally, the pads will wear faster on wet & 
dirty roads. Inspect the pads at each regular 
maintenance interval.
• Front brake (Disc variant)-Check for 
correct brake fluid level in the master 
cylinder (page 51).
• Rear brake (Disc variant)-Check for 
correct brake fluid level in the reservoir 
(page 51).

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and

quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
