the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
To  determine  the  motions  of  two  bodies  attracting  each  other  with  forces 
reciprocally  proportional  to  the  squares  of  their  distance,  and  going
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
If  spheres  it*  the  progress  from  the  centre  to  the  circumference  be  hoivMtv 
dissimilar  a->id  unequable,  but  similar  on  every  side  round  about  af  all 
given  distances  from  the  centre  ;  and  the  attractive  force  of  evsrt/ 
point  be  as  the  distance  of  the  attracted  body  ;  I  say,  that  the  entire 
force  with  which  two  spheres  of  this  kind  attract  each  other  mutitallij 
is  proportional  to  the  distance  between  the  centres  of  the  spheres. 
This  is  demonstrated  from  the  foregoing  Proposition,  in  the  same  man 
ner  as  Proposition  LXXVI  was  demonstrated  from  Proposition  LXXY.
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter.
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, 
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, 
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its 
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no 
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion 
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the 
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some 
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where 
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by 
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute 
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now 
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the

In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac 
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after 
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the 
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of 
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others 
have  greatly  contributed  to  display  the  most  hidden  treasures  of 
the  PRINCIPIA.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore

And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in 
finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected 
globes  would  be  the  same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding 
Propositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity 
of  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity 
of  matter.  By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising 
from  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but 
the  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and 
if  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the 
same ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being 
always  proportional  to  that  force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan 
tity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin 
ished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the 
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the 
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion, 
must  be  utterly  void  of  any  corporeal  fluid,  excepting,  perhaps,  some  ex 
tremely  rare  vapours  and  the  rays  of  light.
experiments  of  pendulums,  as  well  as  by  the  experiments  of  falling  bodies. 
And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving 
in  any  fluids  whatsoever,  though  of  the  most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris 
paribus,  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids.
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of 
gravity,  and  subduct  it  when  the  body  descends  in  a  right  line.  One 
might  also  go  on  to  the  motion  of  bodies  which  are  resisted  in  part  uni 
formly,  in  part  in  the  ratio  of  the  velocity,  and  in  part  in  the  duplicate 
ratio  of  the  same  velocity.  And  I  have  opened  a  way  to  this  in  Prop. 
XIII  and  XIV  foregoing,  in  which  the  uniform  resistance  arising  from  the 
tenacity  of  the  medium  may  be  substituted  for  the  force  of  gravity,  or  be 
compounded  with  it  as  before.  But  I  hasten  to  other  things.
In  the  seventh  section  of  the  second  book  the  theory  of  the  resistances  of  fluids
tions  we  are  not  treating  of  elastic  but  non-elastic  fluids;  not  of  bodies 
floating  on  the  surface  of  the  fluid,  but  deeply  immersed  therein.  And 
when  the  resistance  of  bodies  in  non-elastic  fluids  is  once  known,  we  may 
then  augment  this  resistance  a  little  in  elastic  fluids,  as  our  air;  and  in 
the  surfaces  of  stagnating  fluids,  as  lakes  and  seas.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta

ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
let  fall  at  equal  distances  from  the  sun,  they  would,  in  their  descent  towards 
the  sun,  describe  equal  spaces  in  equal  times.  But  forces  which  equally 
accelerate  unequal  bodies  must  be  as  those  bodies  :  that  is  to  sa_y,  the  weights 
;f  the  planets  towards  the  sun  must  be  as  their  quantities  of  matter, 
further,  that  the  weights  of  Jupiter  and  of  his  satellites  towards  the  sun 
are  proportional  to  the  several  quantities  of  their  matter,  appears  from  the 
exceedingly  regular  motions  of  the  satellites  (by  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXV,  Book 
1).  For  if  some  of  those  bodies  were  more  strongly  attracted  to  the  sun  in 
proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter  than  others,  the  motions  of  the  sat

Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev 
olutions  about  the  sun  agitated  in  the  manner  but  now  described  than  if

if  they  were  attracted  by  a  third  placed  in  the  common  centre  of  their 
gravity ;  and  by  the  hypothesis  that  centre  will  be  quiescent  at  the  begin 
ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the

I  have  hitherto  been  treating  of  the  attractions  of  bodies  towards  an  im 
movable  centre;  though  very  probably  there  is  no  such  thing  existent  in 
nature.  For  attractions  are  made  towards  bodies,  and  the  actions  of  the 
bodies  attracted  and  attracting  are  always  reciprocal  and  equal,  by  Law  III ;
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.
Of  the  motion  of  bodies  in  moveable  orbits  ;  and  of  the  motion  of  the
forces  of  their  gravity  are  drawn  off  from  rectilinear  motions,  and  re

The  case  of  the  6th  Corollary  obtains  in  the  celestial  bodies  (as  Sir 
Christopher  Wren,  Dr.  Hooke,  and  Dr.  Halley  have  severally  observed)  ; 
and  therefore  in  what  follows,  I  intend  to  treat  more  at  large  of  those 
things  which  relate  to  centripetal  force  decreasing  in  a  duplicate  ratio

the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common
orbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro 
portional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop.  LXV.  If  the  sun  was  qui 
escent,  and  the  other  planets  did  not  act  mutually  one  upon  another,  their
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
orbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by 
Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev 
olutions  about  the  sun  agitated  in  the  manner  but  now  described  than  if
That  the  forces  by  which  the  primary  planets  are  continually  drawn  off 
from  rectilinear  motions,  and  retained  in  their  proper  orbits,  tend  to
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
ets,  proved  from  the  eccentricity  of  the  planets,  and  the  very  slow  motion  of  their  apses,      .  520

213,  214).  that  there  are  centripetal  forces  actually  directed  (either  accu

it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
comes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted 
upon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a 
body  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies 
cent  plane.  By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ; 
not  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only  when  they  approach  very  near  to  a 
circular  figure.  A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform  centripetal 
180
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the
COR.  5.  Therefore  the  motion  of  a  body  in  an  immovable  orbit  being 
given,  its  angular  motion  round  the  centre  of  the  forces  may  be  increased 
or  diminished  in  a  given  ratio;  and  thence  new  immovable  orbits  may  be 
found  in  which  bodies  may  revolve  with  new  centripetal  forces.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
Of  the  invention  of  orbits  wherein  bodies  will  revolve,  being  acted  upon 
by  any  sort  of  centripetal  force.
may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the

perficies.  Therefore  the  upper  superficies  AE
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which 
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen 
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity  from  the  second  law  of 
Kepler.
If  a  body  in  an  uniform  medium,  being  uniformly  acted  upon  by  the  force 
of  gravity,  ascends  or  descends  in  a  right  line  ;  and  the  whole  space 
described  be  distinguished  into  equal  parts,  and  in  the  beginning  of 
each  of  the  parts  (by  adding  or  subducting  the  resisting  force  of  the 
medium  to  or  from  the  force  of  gravity,  when  the  body  ascends  or  de 
scends]  yon  collect  the  absolute  forces  ;  I  say,  that  those  absolute  forces 
ire  in  a  geometrical  progression.
The  nature  of  gravity — that  mysterious  power  which  causes 
all  bodies  to  descend  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth — had,  in 
deed,  dawned  upon  him.  And  reason  busily  united  link  to  link 
of  that  chain  which  was  yet  to  be  traced  joining  the  least  to  the 
vastest,  the  most  remote  to  the  nearest,  in  one  harmonious  bond. 
From  the  bottoms  of  the  deepest  caverns  to  the  summits  of  the 
highest  mountains,  this  power  suffers  no  sensible  change  :  may  not
looked  upon."J 
Though  Newton  had  continued  silent,  yet  his  thoughts  were 
by  no  means  inactive  upon  the  vast  subject  of  the  planetary  mo 
tions.  The  idea  of  Universal  Gravitation,  first  caught  sight  of,  so
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both.
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
This  force  is  ever  proportional  to  the  body  whose  force  it  is ;  and  differs 
nothing  from  the  inactivity  of  the  mass,  but  in  our  manner  of  conceiving
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy.

The  nature  of  gravity — that  mysterious  power  which  causes 
all  bodies  to  descend  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth — had,  in 
deed,  dawned  upon  him.  And  reason  busily  united  link  to  link 
of  that  chain  which  was  yet  to  be  traced  joining  the  least  to  the 
vastest,  the  most  remote  to  the  nearest,  in  one  harmonious  bond. 
From  the  bottoms  of  the  deepest  caverns  to  the  summits  of  the 
highest  mountains,  this  power  suffers  no  sensible  change  :  may  not

upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole

to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the

earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter

globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor.

globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.

As  if  the  ordinate  describe  a  parabola,  m  being  —  2,  and  n  =  1,  the  force 
will  be  as  the  given  quantity  2B°,  and  therefore  is  given.  Therefore  with 
a  given  force  the  body  will  move  in  a  parabola,  as  Galileo  has  demon 
strated.  If  the  ordinate  describe  an  hyperbola,  m  being  =  0  —  1,  and  n 
—  1,  the  force  will  be  as  2  A  3  or  2B 3 ;  and  therefore  a  force  which  is  as  the 
cube  of  the  ordinate  will  cause  the  body  to  move  in  an  hyperbola.  But

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both.
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
This  force  is  ever  proportional  to  the  body  whose  force  it  is ;  and  differs 
nothing  from  the  inactivity  of  the  mass,  but  in  our  manner  of  conceiving

That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
By  a  like  reasoning  it  may  be  proved,  that  if  the  gravity  of  the  particles

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the

be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
tive  force  varying  inversely  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  will 
describe  an  elliptical  orbit,  in  one  of  whose  foci  the  attractive 
force  resides.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr.

of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in 
finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected 
globes  would  be  the  same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding 
Propositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity 
of  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity 
of  matter.  By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising 
from  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but 
the  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and 
if  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the 
same ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being 
always  proportional  to  that  force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan 
tity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin 
ished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the 
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the 
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion,

And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving

sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of 
gravity,  and  subduct  it  when  the  body  descends  in  a  right  line.  One 
might  also  go  on  to  the  motion  of  bodies  which  are  resisted  in  part  uni 
formly,  in  part  in  the  ratio  of  the  velocity,  and  in  part  in  the  duplicate 
ratio  of  the  same  velocity.  And  I  have  opened  a  way  to  this  in  Prop. 
XIII  and  XIV  foregoing,  in  which  the  uniform  resistance  arising  from  the 
tenacity  of  the  medium  may  be  substituted  for  the  force  of  gravity,  or  be 
compounded  with  it  as  before.  But  I  hasten  to  other  things.
In  the  seventh  section  of  the  second  book  the  theory  of  the  resistances  of  fluids

from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles.  But  if  that  force  arise  from 
some  other  cause,  as  from  the  expansion  of  the  particles  after  the  manner 
of  wool,  or  the  boughs  of  trees,  or  any  other  cause,  by  which  the  particles 
are  hindered  from  moving  freely  among  themselves,  the  resistance,  by 
reason  of  the  lesser  fluidity  of  the  medium,  will  be  greater  than  in  the 
Corollaries  above.
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac 
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after 
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the 
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of 
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others 
have  greatly  contributed  to  display  the  most  hidden  treasures  of 
the  PRINCIPIA.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other
ISAAC  NEWTON.
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
Society,  with  the  author's  promise  to  have  it  entered  upon  their 
Register.  Newton,  subsequently  reminded  by  the  Society  of  his 
promise,  proceeded  in  the  diligent  preparation  of  the  work,  and. 
though  suffering  an  interruption  of  six  weeks,  transmitted  the 
manuscript  of  the  first  book  to  London  before  the  end  of  April. 
The  work  was  entitled  PHILOSOPHI/E  NATURALIS  PRINCIPIA 
MATHEMATICA,  dedicated  to  the  Royal  Society,  and  presented
it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
comes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted 
upon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a 
body  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies 
cent  plane.  By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ; 
not  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only  when  they  approach  very  near  to  a 
circular  figure.  A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform  centripetal 
180
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the
COR.  5.  Therefore  the  motion  of  a  body  in  an  immovable  orbit  being 
given,  its  angular  motion  round  the  centre  of  the  forces  may  be  increased 
or  diminished  in  a  given  ratio;  and  thence  new  immovable  orbits  may  be 
found  in  which  bodies  may  revolve  with  new  centripetal  forces.
Of  the  invention  of  orbits  wherein  bodies  will  revolve,  being  acted  upon 
by  any  sort  of  centripetal  force.
may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common
orbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro 
portional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop.  LXV.  If  the  sun  was  qui 
escent,  and  the  other  planets  did  not  act  mutually  one  upon  another,  their
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
For  the  revolutions  of  the  circumjovial  planets  about  Jupiter,  of  the 
circumsaturnal  about  Saturn,  and  of  Mercury  and  Venus,  and  the  other 
circumsolar  planets,  about  the  sun,  are  appearances  of  the  same  sort  with 
the  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, 
must  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been 
demonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to 
the  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in 
receding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same 
proportion,  and  according  to  the  same  law,  as  the  force  of  gravity  does  in 
receding  from  the  earth.

Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev

The  hypothesis  of  vortices  is  pressed  with  many  difficulties.  That  every 
planet  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun  may  describe  areas  proportional  to  the 
times  of  description,  the  periodic  times  of  the  several  parts  of  the  vortices 
should  observe  the  duplicate  proportion  of  their  distances  from  the  sun ; 
but  that  the  periodic  times  of  the  planets  may  obtain  the  sesquiplicate  pro 
portion  of  their  distances  from  the  sun;  the  periodic  times  of  the  parts  of 
the  vortex  ought  to  be  in  the  sesquiplicate  proportion  of  their  distances.

Whence  it  was  that  the  planets  came  to  be  retained  within  any  certain 
bounds  in  these  free  spaces,  and  to  be  drawn  off  from  the  rectilinear  courses, 
which,  left  to  themselves,  they  should  have  pursued,  into  regular  revolu 
tions  in  curvilinear  orbits,  are  questions  which  we  do  not  know  how  the 
ancients  explained ;  and  probably  it  was  to  give  some  sort  of  satisfaction 
to  this  difficulty  that  solid  orbs  were  introduced.
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter.
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, 
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, 
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its 
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no 
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion 
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the 
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some 
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where 
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by 
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute 
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now 
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in 
finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected 
globes  would  be  the  same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding 
Propositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity 
of  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity 
of  matter.  By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising 
from  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but 
the  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and 
if  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the 
same ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being 
always  proportional  to  that  force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan 
tity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin 
ished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the 
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the 
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion, 
must  be  utterly  void  of  any  corporeal  fluid,  excepting,  perhaps,  some  ex 
tremely  rare  vapours  and  the  rays  of  light.
experiments  of  pendulums,  as  well  as  by  the  experiments  of  falling  bodies. 
And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving 
in  any  fluids  whatsoever,  though  of  the  most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris 
paribus,  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids.
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of 
gravity,  and  subduct  it  when  the  body  descends  in  a  right  line.  One 
might  also  go  on  to  the  motion  of  bodies  which  are  resisted  in  part  uni 
formly,  in  part  in  the  ratio  of  the  velocity,  and  in  part  in  the  duplicate 
ratio  of  the  same  velocity.  And  I  have  opened  a  way  to  this  in  Prop. 
XIII  and  XIV  foregoing,  in  which  the  uniform  resistance  arising  from  the 
tenacity  of  the  medium  may  be  substituted  for  the  force  of  gravity,  or  be 
compounded  with  it  as  before.  But  I  hasten  to  other  things.

then  augment  this  resistance  a  little  in  elastic  fluids,  as  our  air;  and  in

any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
comes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted 
upon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a 
body  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies 
cent  plane.  By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ;

given,  its  angular  motion  round  the  centre  of  the  forces  may  be  increased 
or  diminished  in  a  given  ratio;  and  thence  new  immovable  orbits  may  be

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

Of  the  Invention  of  Centripetal  Forces.
The  case  of  the  6th  Corollary  obtains  in  the  celestial  bodies  (as  Sir 
Christopher  Wren,  Dr.  Hooke,  and  Dr.  Halley  have  severally  observed)  ; 
and  therefore  in  what  follows,  I  intend  to  treat  more  at  large  of  those 
things  which  relate  to  centripetal  force  decreasing  in  a  duplicate  ratio 
of  the  distances  from  the  centres.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

hitherto  called  centripetal  force;  but  it  being  now  made  plain  that  it  can 
be  no  other  than  a  gravitating  force,  we  shall  hereafter  call  it  gravity. 
For  the  cause  of  that  centripetal  force  which  retains  the  moon  in  its  orbit

will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ;

whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole.  Q.E.D.

Though  Newton  had  continued  silent,  yet  his  thoughts  were 
by  no  means  inactive  upon  the  vast  subject  of  the  planetary  mo 
tions.  The  idea  of  Universal  Gravitation,  first  caught  sight  of,  so
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter.
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, 
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, 
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its 
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no 
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion 
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the 
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some 
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where 
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by 
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute 
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now 
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common
orbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro 
portional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop.  LXV.  If  the  sun  was  qui 
escent,  and  the  other  planets  did  not  act  mutually  one  upon  another,  their
ferent  planes ;  and  the  force  LM,  acting  in  the  direction  of  the  line  PT 
situate  in  the  plane  of  the  orbit  PAB,  will  have  the  same  effect  as  before  ; 
neither  will  it  draw  the  body  P  from  the  plane  of  its  orbit.  But  the  other 
force  NM  acting  in  the  direction  of  a  line  parallel  to  ST  (and  which,  there 
fore,  when  the  body  S  is  without  the  line  of  the  nodes  is  inclined  to  the 
plane  of  the  orbit  PAB),  besides  the  perturbation  of  the  motion  just  now 
spoken  of  as  to  longitude,  introduces  another  perturbation  also  as  to  latitude, 
attracting  the  body  P  out  of  the  plane  of  its  orbit.  And  this  perturbation, 
in  any  given  situation  of  the  bodies  P  and  T  to  each  other,  will  be  as  the 
generating  force  MN ;  and  therefore  becomes  least  when  the  force  MN  is 
least,  that  is  (as  was  just  now  shewn),  where  the  attraction  SN  is  not  nrirb 
greater  nor  much  less  than  the  attraction  SK.  Q.E.D.
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
orbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by 
Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev 
olutions  about  the  sun  agitated  in  the  manner  but  now  described  than  if
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity, 
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in 
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the 
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now
That  the  forces  by  which  the  primary  planets  are  continually  drawn  off 
from  rectilinear  motions,  and  retained  in  their  proper  orbits,  tend  to
COR.  And  hence  if  more  lesser  bodies  revolve  about  the  great  one,  it 
may  easily  be  inferred  that  the  orbits  described  will  approach  nearer  to 
ellipses ;  and  the  descriptions  of  areas  will  be  more  nearly  equable,  if  all 
the  bodies  mutually  attract  and  agitate  each  other  with  accelerative  forces 
that  are  as  their  absolute  forces  directly,  and  the  squares  of  the  distances 
inversely  :  and  if  the  focus  of  each  orbit  be  placed  in  the  common  centre 
of  gravity  of  all  the  interior  bodies  (that  is.  if  the  focus  of  the  first  and  in 
nermost  orbit  be  placed  in  the  centre  of  gravity  of  the  greatest  and  inner 
most  body  :  the  focus  of  the  second  orbit  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity 
of  the  two  innermost  bodies;  the  focus  of  the  third  orbit  in  the  common 
centre  of  gravity  of  the  three  innermost ;  and  so  on),  than  if  the  innermost 
body  were  at  rest,  and  was  made  the  common  focus  of  all  the  orbits.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.
These  quantities  of  forces,  we  may,  for  brevity's  sake,  call  by  the  names 
of  motive,  accelerative,  and  absolute  forces ;  and,  for  distinction's  sake,  con 
sider  them,  with  respect  to  the  bodies  that  tend  to  the  centre ;  to  the  places 
of  those  bodies ;  and  to  the  centre  of  force  towards  which  they  tend  ;  that

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo

forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it
This  proportion,  first  observed  by  Kepler,  is  now  received  by  all  astron 
omers  ;  for  the  periodic  times  are  the  same,  and  the  dimensions  of  the  orbits 
are  the  same,  whether  the  sun  revolves  about  the  earth,  or  the  earth  about 
the  sun.  And  as  to  the  measures  of  the  periodic  times,  all  astronomers  are
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
let  fall  at  equal  distances  from  the  sun,  they  would,  in  their  descent  towards 
the  sun,  describe  equal  spaces  in  equal  times.  But  forces  which  equally 
accelerate  unequal  bodies  must  be  as  those  bodies  :  that  is  to  sa_y,  the  weights 
;f  the  planets  towards  the  sun  must  be  as  their  quantities  of  matter, 
further,  that  the  weights  of  Jupiter  and  of  his  satellites  towards  the  sun 
are  proportional  to  the  several  quantities  of  their  matter,  appears  from  the 
exceedingly  regular  motions  of  the  satellites  (by  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXV,  Book 
1).  For  if  some  of  those  bodies  were  more  strongly  attracted  to  the  sun  in 
proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter  than  others,  the  motions  of  the  sat
orbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by 
Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev

gravity ;  and  by  the  hypothesis  that  centre  will  be  quiescent  at  the  begin 
ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
f  'f  the  motions  of  bodies  tending'  to  each  other  with  centripetal  forces. 
I  have  hitherto  been  treating  of  the  attractions  of  bodies  towards  an  im 
movable  centre;  though  very  probably  there  is  no  such  thing  existent  in 
nature.  For  attractions  are  made  towards  bodies,  and  the  actions  of  the 
bodies  attracted  and  attracting  are  always  reciprocal  and  equal,  by  Law  III ;
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.
Of  the  motion  of  bodies  in  moveable  orbits  ;  and  of  the  motion  of  the
forces  of  their  gravity  are  drawn  off  from  rectilinear  motions,  and  re 
tained  in  curvilinear  orbits.
It  is  indeed  a  matter  of  great  difficulty  to  discover,  and  effectually  to 
distinguish,  the  true  motions  of  particular  bodies  from  the  apparent ;  be 
cause  the  parts  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  those  motions  are  per 
formed,  do  by  no  means  come  under  the  observation  of  our  senses.  Yet 
the  thing  is  not  altogether  desperate :  for  we  have  some  arguments  to 
guide  us,  partly  from  the  apparent  motions,  which  are  the  differences  of 
the  true  motions ;  partly  from  the  forces,  which  are  the  causes  and  effects 
of  the  true  motions.  For  instance,  if  tAvo  globes,  kept  at  a  given  distance 
one  from  the  other  by  means  of  a  cord  that  connects  them,  were  revolved 
about  their  common  centre  of  gravity,  we  might,  from  the  tension  of  the 
cord,  discover  the  endeavour  of  the  globes  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  their 
motion,  and  from  thence  we  might  compute  the  quantity  of  their  circular

the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.

similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be

distribution  of  hiit  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
COR.  5.  Therefore  the  motion  of  a  body  in  an  immovable  orbit  being 
given,  its  angular  motion  round  the  centre  of  the  forces  may  be  increased 
or  diminished  in  a  given  ratio;  and  thence  new  immovable  orbits  may  be 
found  in  which  bodies  may  revolve  with  new  centripetal  forces.

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
looked  upon."J 
Though  Newton  had  continued  silent,  yet  his  thoughts  were 
by  no  means  inactive  upon  the  vast  subject  of  the  planetary  mo 
tions.  The  idea  of  Universal  Gravitation,  first  caught  sight  of,  so
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter.
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, 
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, 
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its 
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no 
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion 
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the 
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some 
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where 
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by 
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute 
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now 
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which 
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen 
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity  from  the  second  law  of 
Kepler.

be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other
tely  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore

And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in 
finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected 
globes  would  be  the  same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding 
Propositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity 
of  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity 
of  matter.  By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising 
from  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but 
the  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and 
if  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the 
same ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being 
always  proportional  to  that  force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan 
tity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin 
ished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the 
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the 
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion,

sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math

with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im

be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.
Because  the  fixed  stars  are  quiescent  one  in  respect  of  another  (p.  401, 
4U2),  we  may  consider  the  sun,  earth,  and  planets,  as  one  system  of  bodies 
carried  hither  and  thither  by  various  motions  among  themselves;  and  the 
common  centre  of  gravity  of  all  (by  Cor.  IT  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
either  be  quiescent,  or  move  uniformly  forward  in  a  right  line :  in  which 
case  the  whole  system  will  likewise  move  uniformly  forward  in  right  lines. 
But  this  is  an  hypothesis  hardly  to  be  admitted ;  and,  therefore,  setting  it

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re

total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the

the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common

therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of

II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less 
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under 
stood  in  the  following  discourse.  I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and 
motion,  as  being  well  known  to  all.  Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar 
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common.
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen

remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
The  nature  of  gravity — that  mysterious  power  which  causes

of  that  chain  which  was  yet  to  be  traced  joining  the  least  to  the

be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo

with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir,

Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should

That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have

mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which 
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen 
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity  from  the  second  law  of 
Kepler.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore

And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in 
finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected 
globes  would  be  the  same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding 
Propositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity 
of  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity 
of  matter.  By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising 
from  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but 
the  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and 
if  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the 
same ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being 
always  proportional  to  that  force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan 
tity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin 
ished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the 
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the 
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion, 
must  be  utterly  void  of  any  corporeal  fluid,  excepting,  perhaps,  some  ex

sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain

cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected 
globes  would  be  the  same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding 
Propositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity 
of  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity 
of  matter.  By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising 
from  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but 
the  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and 
if  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the 
same ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being 
always  proportional  to  that  force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan 
tity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin 
ished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the 
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the 
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion, 
must  be  utterly  void  of  any  corporeal  fluid,  excepting,  perhaps,  some  ex 
tremely  rare  vapours  and  the  rays  of  light.
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which 
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen 
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity  from  the  second  law  of 
Kepler.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which 
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen 
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity  from  the  second  law  of 
Kepler.

• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

| WARNING
!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.
(c) Brake pad wear (Disc variant)
Brake pad wear depends upon the severity of 
usage, the type of riding & road conditions. 
Generally, the pads will wear faster on wet & 
dirty roads. Inspect the pads at each regular 
maintenance interval.

Master Cylinder/Reservoir.
Location: Right handlebar.
Fluid level-Ensure that the brake fluid level 
does not fall below “MIN” mark (1) on the 
master cylinder, when checked with the 
master cylinder parallel to the ground. The 
level decreases gradually due to piston 
movement to compensate pad wear. If the 
level decreases abruptly, check for leakage in 
the brake system and contact your Authorised 
Hero MoroCorp workshop.
• Front brake (Disc variant)-Check for 
correct brake fluid level in the master 
cylinder (page 51).

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac 
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after 
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the 
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of 
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others 
have  greatly  contributed  to  display  the  most  hidden  treasures  of 
the  PRINCIPIA.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver

plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Supposing  that  the  centripetal  force  is  reciprocally  proportional  to  tht 
square  of  tlie  distance  of  the  places  from  the  centre ;  it  is  required
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which 
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen 
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity  from  the  second  law  of 
Kepler.
hitherto  called  centripetal  force;  but  it  being  now  made  plain  that  it  can 
be  no  other  than  a  gravitating  force,  we  shall  hereafter  call  it  gravity. 
For  the  cause  of  that  centripetal  force  which  retains  the  moon  in  its  orbit 
will  extend  itself  to  all  the  planets,  by  Rule  I,  II,  and  IV.
The  nature  of  gravity — that  mysterious  power  which  causes 
all  bodies  to  descend  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth — had,  in 
deed,  dawned  upon  him.  And  reason  busily  united  link  to  link 
of  that  chain  which  was  yet  to  be  traced  joining  the  least  to  the 
vastest,  the  most  remote  to  the  nearest,  in  one  harmonious  bond. 
From  the  bottoms  of  the  deepest  caverns  to  the  summits  of  the 
highest  mountains,  this  power  suffers  no  sensible  change  :  may  not
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according

compounded  from  the  determination  of  both.
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore

And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in 
finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected 
globes  would  be  the  same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding 
Propositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity 
of  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity 
of  matter.  By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising 
from  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but 
the  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and 
if  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the 
same ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being 
always  proportional  to  that  force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan 
tity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin 
ished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the 
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the 
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion, 
must  be  utterly  void  of  any  corporeal  fluid,  excepting,  perhaps,  some  ex

sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
(c) Brake pad wear (Disc variant)
Brake pad wear depends upon the severity of 
usage, the type of riding & road conditions. 
Generally, the pads will wear faster on wet & 
dirty roads. Inspect the pads at each regular 
maintenance interval.

Fluid level-Ensure that the brake fluid level 
does not fall below “MIN” mark (1) on the 
master cylinder, when checked with the 
master cylinder parallel to the ground. The 
level decreases gradually due to piston 
movement to compensate pad wear. If the 
level decreases abruptly, check for leakage in 
the brake system and contact your Authorised 
Hero MoroCorp workshop.

as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra
that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which 
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to  have  indepen 
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity  from  the  second  law  of 
Kepler.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is 
iouble ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple,
quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

hitherto  called  centripetal  force;  but  it  being  now  made  plain  that  it  can 
be  no  other  than  a  gravitating  force,  we  shall  hereafter  call  it  gravity. 
For  the  cause  of  that  centripetal  force  which  retains  the  moon  in  its  orbit 
will  extend  itself  to  all  the  planets,  by  Rule  I,  II,  and  IV.
The  nature  of  gravity — that  mysterious  power  which  causes 
all  bodies  to  descend  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth — had,  in 
deed,  dawned  upon  him.  And  reason  busily  united  link  to  link 
of  that  chain  which  was  yet  to  be  traced  joining  the  least  to  the 
vastest,  the  most  remote  to  the  nearest,  in  one  harmonious  bond. 
From  the  bottoms  of  the  deepest  caverns  to  the  summits  of  the 
highest  mountains,  this  power  suffers  no  sensible  change  :  may  not

Though  Newton  had  continued  silent,  yet  his  thoughts  were 
by  no  means  inactive  upon  the  vast  subject  of  the  planetary  mo

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
by  the  general  mind.  Pemberton's  popular  "  View  of  Sir  Isaac 
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in  1728  ;  and  the  year  after 
ward,  an  English  translation  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  and  System  of  the 
World,  by  Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that  period,  the  labours  of 
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of  Thorpe,  of  Jebb,  of  Wright  and  others 
have  greatly  contributed  to  display  the  most  hidden  treasures  of 
the  PRINCIPIA.
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in 
finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected 
globes  would  be  the  same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding 
Propositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity 
of  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity 
of  matter.  By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising 
from  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but 
the  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and 
if  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the 
same ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being 
always  proportional  to  that  force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan 
tity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin 
ished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the 
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the 
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion, 
must  be  utterly  void  of  any  corporeal  fluid,  excepting,  perhaps,  some  ex 
tremely  rare  vapours  and  the  rays  of  light.
experiments  of  pendulums,  as  well  as  by  the  experiments  of  falling  bodies. 
And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving 
in  any  fluids  whatsoever,  though  of  the  most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris 
paribus,  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids.
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of 
gravity,  and  subduct  it  when  the  body  descends  in  a  right  line.  One 
might  also  go  on  to  the  motion  of  bodies  which  are  resisted  in  part  uni 
formly,  in  part  in  the  ratio  of  the  velocity,  and  in  part  in  the  duplicate 
ratio  of  the  same  velocity.  And  I  have  opened  a  way  to  this  in  Prop. 
XIII  and  XIV  foregoing,  in  which  the  uniform  resistance  arising  from  the 
tenacity  of  the  medium  may  be  substituted  for  the  force  of  gravity,  or  be 
compounded  with  it  as  before.  But  I  hasten  to  other  things.
In  the  seventh  section  of  the  second  book  the  theory  of  the  resistances  of  fluids

that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra

the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.

during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.
TUBELESS TYRES
TUBELESS TYRES 
59
Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the

be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.
In  the  seventh  section  of  the  second  book  the  theory  of  the  resistances  of  fluids
"            of  fluids  threefold,  arises  either  from  the  inactivity  of  the  fluid  matter,  or  the  te

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra

the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is

quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

Lubrication
• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-

| WARNING
!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is 
iouble ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple,
quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra
that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.
In  the  seventh  section  of  the  second  book  the  theory  of  the  resistances  of  fluids
"            of  fluids  threefold,  arises  either  from  the  inactivity  of  the  fluid  matter,  or  the  te

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra
that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is

the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena

that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver

fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra
that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from 
the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move

ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti

Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any

Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move

ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the

It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other

• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

| WARNING
!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.
In  the  seventh  section  of  the  second  book  the  theory  of  the  resistances  of  fluids
"            of  fluids  threefold,  arises  either  from  the  inactivity  of  the  fluid  matter,  or  the  te

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti

Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti

Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.

• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is 
iouble ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple,
quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

tenth  part  of  its  motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases 
in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.

Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen

remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun*

The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver

mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered
