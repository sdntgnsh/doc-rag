• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

Lubrication
• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

| WARNING
!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

• To drain the oil, remove the oil level dipstick 
(page 39) and drain bolt (1) with sealing 
washer (2).
• After the oil has completely drained, 
reinstall the drain bolt with a new sealing 
washer.
Oil circulation inspection
• Start the engine and allow it to idle for few 
minutes.
• Stop the engine, let the engine oil settle 
down and recheck the oil level.
• Make sure that oil level is at the “UPPER”
level mark of the oil level dipstick with the 
vehicle in an upright position and that there 
are no oil leaks.
• Remove the oil filter screen (9) and wash it 
in clean non flammable or high flash point 
solvent (kerosene).

Lubrication
• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

| --- | --- |
| Rear | 90/90-18 51P (Tubeless tyre) |
| WARNING
!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.
(c) Brake pad wear (Disc variant)
Brake pad wear depends upon the severity of 
usage, the type of riding & road conditions. 
Generally, the pads will wear faster on wet & 
dirty roads. Inspect the pads at each regular 
maintenance interval.
• Front brake (Disc variant)-Check for 
correct brake fluid level in the master 
cylinder (page 51).
• Rear brake (Disc variant)-Check for 
correct brake fluid level in the reservoir 
(page 51).

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and

quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed
Of  the,  motion  of  fluids,  and  the  resistance  made  to  projected  bodies.
Suppose  the  uniform  force  of  gravity  to  tend  directly  to  the  plane  of  the 
horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the 
square  of  the  velocity  coiijunctly  :  it  is  proposed  to  find  the  density  of 
the  medium  in  each  place,  which  shall  make  the  body  move  in  any 
given  carve  line  ;  the  velocity  of  the  body  and  the  resistance  of  the 
medium  in  each  place.

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common
orbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro 
portional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop.  LXV.  If  the  sun  was  qui 
escent,  and  the  other  planets  did  not  act  mutually  one  upon  another,  their
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
orbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by 
Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev 
olutions  about  the  sun  agitated  in  the  manner  but  now  described  than  if

any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ;

That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
comes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted 
upon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a 
body  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies 
cent  plane.  By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ; 
not  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only  when  they  approach  very  near  to  a 
circular  figure.  A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform  centripetal

given,  its  angular  motion  round  the  centre  of  the  forces  may  be  increased 
or  diminished  in  a  given  ratio;  and  thence  new  immovable  orbits  may  be 
found  in  which  bodies  may  revolve  with  new  centripetal  forces.

force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra

the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is 
iouble ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple,
quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.
if  they  were  attracted  by  a  third  placed  in  the  common  centre  of  their 
gravity ;  and  by  the  hypothesis  that  centre  will  be  quiescent  at  the  begin 
ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any

attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor.

This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta

ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of 
turpentine,  and  salts,  in  oil  cleared  of  its  fseces  by  distillation  and  warmed, 
in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such 
like,  that  are  fluid  enough  to  retaia  for  some  time  the  motion  impressed

horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the

IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter.
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, 
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, 
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its 
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no 
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion 
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the 
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some 
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where 
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by 
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute 
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now 
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions.

• Use only tubeless tyres on this vehicle. The 
rims are designed for tubeless tyres, and 
during hard acceleration or braking, a tube-
type tyre could slip on the rim and cause the 
tyre to rapidly deflate.
• Do not install a tube inside a tubeless tyre on 
this vehicle. Excessive heat buildup can 
cause the tube to burst.
The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra

the  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor.  Prop.  XXII,  Book  II,
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common
orbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro 
portional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop.  LXV.  If  the  sun  was  qui 
escent,  and  the  other  planets  did  not  act  mutually  one  upon  another,  their
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
orbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by 
Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev 
olutions  about  the  sun  agitated  in  the  manner  but  now  described  than  if

force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
comes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted 
upon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a 
body  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies 
cent  plane.  By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ; 
not  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only  when  they  approach  very  near  to  a 
circular  figure.  A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform  centripetal

COR.  5.  Therefore  the  motion  of  a  body  in  an  immovable  orbit  being 
given,  its  angular  motion  round  the  centre  of  the  forces  may  be  increased 
or  diminished  in  a  given  ratio;  and  thence  new  immovable  orbits  may  be 
found  in  which  bodies  may  revolve  with  new  centripetal  forces.

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

This  "  warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth  by  Dr. 
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a  minute  and  positive  refuta 
tions  of  such  claims,  yet,  to  reconcile  all  differences,  he  gener 
ously  added  to  Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6,  Book  I,  a  Scholium,  in  which

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.

if  they  were  attracted  by  a  third  placed  in  the  common  centre  of  their 
gravity ;  and  by  the  hypothesis  that  centre  will  be  quiescent  at  the  begin 
ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.
Of  the  motion  of  bodies  in  moveable  orbits  ;  and  of  the  motion  of  the

NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver

pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common
orbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro 
portional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop.  LXV.  If  the  sun  was  qui 
escent,  and  the  other  planets  did  not  act  mutually  one  upon  another,  their
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
orbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by 
Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev

it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
comes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted 
upon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a 
body  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies 
cent  plane.  By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ; 
not  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only  when  they  approach  very  near  to  a 
circular  figure.  A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform  centripetal

COR.  5.  Therefore  the  motion  of  a  body  in  an  immovable  orbit  being 
given,  its  angular  motion  round  the  centre  of  the  forces  may  be  increased 
or  diminished  in  a  given  ratio;  and  thence  new  immovable  orbits  may  be 
found  in  which  bodies  may  revolve  with  new  centripetal  forces.
Of  the  invention  of  orbits  wherein  bodies  will  revolve,  being  acted  upon

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui-

plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra
that  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is

ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first

gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the

THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen

remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun*

The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver

pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
comes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted 
upon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a 
body  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies 
cent  plane.  By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ; 
not  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only  when  they  approach  very  near  to  a 
circular  figure.  A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform  centripetal

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common
orbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro 
portional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop.  LXV.  If  the  sun  was  qui

the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
orbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by 
Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
as  the  square  of  the  distance,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui- 
plicate  ratio  of  the  distance.  Suppose  the  compressing  force  to  be  in  a  du 
plicate  ratio  of  the  density,  and  the  gravity  reciprocally  in  a  duplicate  ra

COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of

particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other

Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.
if  they  were  attracted  by  a  third  placed  in  the  common  centre  of  their 
gravity ;  and  by  the  hypothesis  that  centre  will  be  quiescent  at  the  begin 
ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves.

IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter.
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, 
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, 
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its 
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no 
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion 
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the 
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some 
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where 
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by 
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute 
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now 
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions.
NEWTON'S  PRINCIPIA.
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro
THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen 
erally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat 
remarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with
It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver

pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but
of  computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any 
mathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator 
of  the  ancients.  Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir 
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.  I  have  heard 
him  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely 
than  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin 
ning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works 
of  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered 
the  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a
Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common
orbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro 
portional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop.  LXV.  If  the  sun  was  qui 
escent,  and  the  other  planets  did  not  act  mutually  one  upon  another,  their
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of
orbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by 
Prop.  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII).  But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir 
themselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no 
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev

any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
comes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted 
upon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a 
body  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies 
cent  plane.  By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ; 
not  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only  when  they  approach  very  near  to  a 
circular  figure.  A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform  centripetal

given,  its  angular  motion  round  the  centre  of  the  forces  may  be  increased 
or  diminished  in  a  given  ratio;  and  thence  new  immovable  orbits  may  be 
found  in  which  bodies  may  revolve  with  new  centripetal  forces.

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies.

body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of
squares  of  the  distances  between  the  centres  inversely.
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface 
of  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from 
their  centres.
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves.
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-
Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser 
vations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and 
that  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; 
that  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates 
towards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the 
moon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth.
And  as,  from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it  necessarily  follows 
that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  must  press  downwards,  and  therefore  must
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain.
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the

Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by
Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter 
which  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is 
attracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that

the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is

gravity ;  and  by  the  hypothesis  that  centre  will  be  quiescent  at  the  begin 
ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.
Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first

sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the

in  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times 
lighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is 
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore 
in  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move
sides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist 
ance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of 
the  fluids  in  which  they  move.  I  do  not  say  accurately ;  for  more  tena 
cious  fluids,  of  equal  density,  will  undoubtedly  resist  more  than  those  that 
are  more  liquid ;  as  cold  oil  more  than  warm,  warm  oil  more  than  rain 
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of  wine.  But  in  liquors,  which  are  sen 
sibly  fluid  enough,  as  in  air,  in  salt  and  fresh  water,  in  spirit  of  wine,  of

in  oil  of  vitriol,  and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals,  and  any  other  such

horizon,  and  the  resistance  to  be  as  the  density  of  the  medium  and  the

IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions.
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter.
A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, 
whatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, 
which  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its 
place.  Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no 
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion 
is  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the 
motion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some 
immovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor.  Where 
fore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by 
immovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute 
motions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places.  Now 
no  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions.

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a 
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won 
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies." 
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be 
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred 
years  before  this  memorable  birth. 
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com 
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with 
small  one  which  she  possessed  at  Sewstern,  in  Leicestershire,  yield 
ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum, 
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa 
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years, 
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care 
of  her  own  mother. 
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; 
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at 
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. 
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- 
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary. 
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con 
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no 
charms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the 
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem 
ingly  dull  student  gave  him  a  severe

follow, ng  inscription  : — 
"  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  son  of  John  Newton,  Lord  of  the  Manor 
of  Woolsthorpe,  was  born  in  this  room,  on  the  25th  of  December, 
1642."

years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled ;  and,  in 
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}' 
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity. 
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state 
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most 
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal 
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu 
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean 
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the 
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid, 
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably 
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was 
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge. 
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who 
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose. 
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand 
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces 
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve 
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern 
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father 
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable 
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the 
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit ;  and  the  other, 
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit, 
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con 
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he

chiefly,  in  the  possession  of  the  family  of  the  Earl  of  Portsmouth, 
through  the  Viscountess  Lymington. 
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che 
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are 
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the 
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  Edinburgh. 
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke 
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in 
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: — " 'Tis  built  of  stone, 
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good 
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-, 
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger 
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University. 
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of 
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down 
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr 
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir 
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple- 
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned 
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed 
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved 
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with 
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white 
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the 
follow, ng  inscription  : —

of  Woolsthorpe,  was  born  in  this  room,  on  the  25th  of  December,

of  discovery — the  stirring  elements  of  that  wondrous  spirit, 
which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through 
deep  onward  through  deep  of  Nature's  mysteries,  unlocking  her 
strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere  si 
lently  conquering. 
Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures, 
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn, 
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He 
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making 
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated, 
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early 
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She 
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe ;  but 
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham. 
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same 
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per 
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the 
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed, 
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune 
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar 
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated 
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and 
kindness. 
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took 
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen 
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, 
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him 
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage 
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When

FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling 
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control 
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din 
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and 
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and 
moral  truth ;  ascending  height  after  height ;  sweeping  afar  over 
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en 
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly 
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose, 
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its 
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous 
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo 
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis 
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect 
God. 
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain, 
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De 
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the 
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New 
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his 
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi 
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the 
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and 
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness, 
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise 
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON,  13 
turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed

Of  the  invention  of  orbits  wherein  bodies  will  revolve,  being  acted  upon 
by  any  sort  of  centripetal  force. 
PROPOSITION  XL.     THEOREM  XIII. 
//'  a  body,  acted  upon  by  any  centripetal  force,  is  any  how  moved,  and 
another  body  ascends  or  descends  in  a  right  line,  and  their  velocities

equal  at  all  equal  altitudes. 
Let  a  body  descend  from  A  through  D  and  E,  to  the  centre 
(j :  and  let  another  body  move  from  V  in  the  curve  line  VIK&. 
From  the  centre  C,  with  any  distances,  describe  the  concentric 
circles  DI,  EK,  meeting  the  right  line  AC  in  I)  and  E;  and

or  IN  between  the  circumferences  of  the  circles  be  very  small ;  K/ 
and  imagine  the  bodies  in  D  and  I  to  have  equal  velocities. 
Then  because  the  distances  CD  and  CI  are  equal,  the  centri

expressed  by  the  equal  lineoke  DE  and  IN ;  and  let  the  force 
IN  (by  Cor.  2  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  be  resolved  into  two 
others,  NT  and  IT.  rl  hen  the  force  NT  acting  in  the  direction

or  change  the  velocity  of  the  body  in  that  path,  but  only  draw  it  aside 
from  a  rectilinear  course,  and  make  it  deflect  perpetually  from  the  tangent 
of  the  orbit,  and  proceed  in  the  curvilinear  path  ITK/j.  That  whole 
force,  therefore,  will  be  spent  in  producing  this  effect:  but  the  other  force

  is  gravity,  by  which  bodies  tend  to  the  centre  of  the  earth 
magnetism,  by  which  iron  tends  to  the  loadstone ;  and  that  force,  what 
ever  it  is,  by  which  the  planets  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from  the  rec 
tilinear  motions,  which  otherwise  they  would  pursue,  and  made  to  revolve 
in  curvilinear  orbits.  A  stone,  whirled  about  in  a  sling,  endeavours  to  re 
cede  from  the  hand  that  turns  it ;  and  by  that  endeavour,  distends  the 
sling,  and  that  with  so  much  the  greater  force,  as  it  is  revolved  with  the 
greater  velocity,  and  as  soon  as  ever  it  is  let  go,  flies  away.  That  force 
which  opposes  itself  to  this  endeavour,  and  by  which  the  sling  perpetually 
draws  back  the  stone  towards  the  hand,  and  retains  it  in  its  orbit,  because 
it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them 
to,  and  detains  them  in  their  orbits,  which  I  therefore  call  centripetal,  would 
tiy  off  in  right  lines,  with  an  uniform  motion.  A  projectile,  if  it  was  not 
for  the  force  of  gravity,  would  not  deviate  towards  the  earth,  tut  would
at  revolves  about 
the  centre  of  force  in  the  same  manner  as  another  body  in  the  same 
trajectory  at  rest. 
In.  the  orbit  VPK,  given  by  position,  let  the  body 
P  revolve,   proceeding  from   V  towards  K.     From 
the  centre  C  let  there  be  continually  drawn  Cp,  equal 
to  CP,  making  the  angle  VC/?  proportional  to  the 
angle  VCP ;  and  the  area  which  the  line  Cp  describes 
will  be  to  the  area  VCP,  which  the  line  CP  describes 
at  the  same  time,  ns  the  velocity  of  the  describing 
line  Cp  to  the  velocity  of  the  describing  line  CP ; 
that  is,  as  the  angle  VC/?  to  the  angle  VCP,  therefore  in  a  given  ratio, 
and  therefore  proportional  to  the  time.     Since,  then,  the  area  described  by 
the  line  Cp  in  an  immovable  plane  is  proportional  to  the  time,  it  is  manifest 
that  a  body,  being  acted  upon  by  a  just  quantity  of  centripetal  force  may

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies. 
The  preceding  Proposition  may  be  likewise  demonstrated  after  this 
manner.  In  any  circle  suppose  a  polygon  to  be  inscribed  of  any  number 
of  sides.  And  if  a  body,  moved  with  a  given  velocity  along  the  sides  of  the 
polygon,  is  reflected  from  the  circle  at  the  several  angular  points,  the  force, 
with  which  at  every  reflection  it  strikes  the  circle,  will  be  as  its  velocity  : 
and  therefore  the  sum  of  the  forces,  in  a  given  time,  will  be  as  that  ve 
locity  and  the  number  of  reflections  conjunctly ;  that  is  (if  the  species  of 
the  polygon  be  given),  as  the  length  described  in  that  given  time,  and  in 
creased  or  diminished  in  the  ratio  of  the  same  length  to  the  radius  of  the 
circle ;  that  is,  as  the  square  of  that  length  applied  to  the  radius ;  and 
therefore  the  polygon,  by  having  its  sides  diminished  in'inftnitum,  coin 
cides  with  the  circle,  as  the  square  of  the  arc  described  in  a  given  time  ap 
plied  to  the  radius.  This  is  the  centrifugal  force,  with  which  the  body 
impels  the  circle ;  and  to  which  the  contrary  force,  wherewith  the  circle 
continually  repels  the  body  towards  the  centre,
er  by  the  force  of  gravity,  if  it 
is  endued  with  gravity,  or  by  any  other  force,  that  impels  it  towards  the 
earth,  may  be  perpetually  drawn  aside  towards  the  earth,  out  of  the  r&ti- 
linear  way,  which  by  its  innate  force  it  would  pursue;  and  would  be  made 
to  revolve  in  the  orbit  which  it  now  describes ;  nor  could  the  moon  with 
out  some  such  force,  be  retained  in  its  orbit.  If  this  force  was  too  small, 
it  would  not  sufficiently  turn  the  moon  out  of  a  rectilinear  course :  if  it 
was  too  great,  it  would  turn  it  too  much,  arid  draw  down  the  moon  from 
its  orbit  towards  the  earth.  It  is  necessary,  that  the  force  be  of  a  just 
quantity,  and  it  belongs  to  the  mathematicians  to  find  the  force,  that  may 
serve  exactly  to  retain  a  body  in  a  given  orbit,  with  a  given  velocity ;  and 
vice  versa,  to  determine  the  curvilinear  way,  into  which  a  body  projected 
from  a  given  place,  with  a  given  velocity,  may  be  made  to  deviate  from 
its  natural  rectilinear  way,  by  means  of  a  given  force. 
The  quantity  of  any  centripetal  force  may  be  considered  as  of  three 
kinds;  aboolu'e,  accelerative,  and  motive. 
DEFINITION  VI. 
The  absolute  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure  f>f  the  same 
proportional  to  the  efficacy  of  the  cause  that  propagates  it  from  the  cen 
tre,  through  the  spaces  round  about. 
Thus  the  magnetic  force  is  greater  in  one  load-stone  and  less  in  another 
according  to  their  sizes  and  strength  of  intensity.
is  most  certain  that  these  effects  must  proceed 
from  the  action  of  some  force  or  other. 
But  our  purpose  is  only  to  trace  out  the  quantity  and  properties  of  this 
force  from  the  phenomena  (p.  218),  and  to  apply  what  we  discover  in  some 
simple  cases  as  principles,  by  which,  in  a  mathematical  way,  we  may  esti 
mate  the  effects  thereof  in  more  involved  cases :  for  it  would  be  endless  and 
impossible  to  bring  every  particular  to  direct  and  immediate  observation. 
We  said,  in  a  mathematical  way,  to  avoid  all  questions  about  the  na 
ture  or  quality  of  this  force,  which  we  would  not  be  understood  to  deter 
mine  by  any  hypothesis;  and  therefore  call  it  by  the  general  name  of  a 
centripetal  force,  as  it  is  a  force  which  is  directed  towards  some  centre ; 
and  as  it  regards  more  particularly  a  body  in  that  centre,  we  call  it  circum 
solar,  circum-terrestrial,  circum-jovial ;  and  in  like  manner  in  respect  of 
other  central  bodies. 
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
h 
this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi 
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have 
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines. 
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the 
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy. 
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved 
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which 
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but 
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, 
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, 
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht 
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. 
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1), 
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the 
planets. 
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de 
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an 
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces 
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for

time  ABK1,  the  space  of  descent  BFK ;  and  in  the  time  IKki  the  space  of 
descent  KFfk;  and  the  velocities  of  the  bodies  (proportional  to  the  re 
sistance  of  the  medium)  in  these  periods  of  time  will  be  ABED,  ABed,  O, 
ABFI,  AB/z  respectively ;  and  the  greatest  velocity  which  the  body  can 
acquire  by  descending  will  be  BACH. 
For  let  the  rectangle  BACH  be  resolved  into  in 
numerable  rectangles  AA',  K/,  Lm,  M//,  *fea,  which 
shall  be  as  the  increments  of  the  velocities  produced 
in  so  many  equal  times;  then  will  0,  AAr,  AL  Am,  An,

sition)  as  the  resistances  of  the  medium  in  the  be-    
ginning  of  each  of  the  equal  times.     Make  AC  to  AJLLB 
AK,  or  ABHC  to  AB/vK,  as  the  force  of  gravity  to  the  resistance  in  the 
beginning  of  the  second  time ;  then  from  the  force  of  gravity  subduct  the 
resistances,  and  ABHC,  K/vHC,  L/HC,  MwHC,  (fee.,  will  be  as  the  abso 
lute  forces  with  which  the  body  is  acted  upon  in  the  beginning  of  each  of

is,  as  the  rectangles  AA-,  K/,  Lm,  M//,  (fee.,  and  therefore  (by  Lem.  1,  Book

area  AB^K  (by  Corol.  3,  Lem.  VII  and  VIII,  Book  I)  is  to  the  area  Bkq 
as  
 by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica

Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to

The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every

squares  of  their  distances — is  the  discovery  w?  ich  characterizes 
The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo 
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true.

force  is  not  directed  from  P  to  T  ;  and,  secondly,  because  it  is  not  recipro 
cally  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  distance  PT.  These  things  being 
premised,  it  is  manifest  that  the  areas  are  then  most  nearly  proportional  to 
the  times,  when  that  third  force  is  the  least  possible,  the  rest  preserving 
their  former  quantity  ;  and  that  the  orbit  PAB  does  then  approach  nearest 
to  the  elliptical  figure  above-mentioned,  when  both  the  second  and  third, 
but  especially  the  third  force,  is  the  least  possible;  the  first  force  remain

Let  the  accelerative  attraction  of  the  body  T  towards  S  be  expressed  by 
the  line  SN  ;  then  if  the  accelerative  attractions  SM  and  SN  were  equal, 
these,  attracting  the  bodies  T  and  P  equally  and  in  parallel  directions 
would  not  at  all  change  their  situation  with  respect  to  each  other.  The  mo 
tions  of  the  bodies  between  themselves  would  be  the  same  in  that  case  as  if 
those  attractions  did  not  act  at  all,  by  Cor.  6,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion.  And, 
by  a  like  reasoning,  if  the  attraction  SN  is  less  than  the  attraction  SM,  it 
will  take  away  out  of  the  attraction  SM  the  part  SN,  so  that  there  will  re 
main  only  the  part  (of  the  attraction)  MN  to  disturb  the  proportionality  of 
the  areas  and  times,  and  the  elliptical  figure  of  the  orbit.  And  in  like 
manner  if  the  attraction  SN  be  greater  than  the  attraction  SM,  the  pertur 
bation  of  the  orbit  and  proportion  will  be  produced  by  the  difference  MN 
alone.  After  this  manner  the  attraction  SN  reduces  always  the  attraction

His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven 
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor 
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes 
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his 
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New 
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug 
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669. 
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ; 
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis 
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science, 
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name. 
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method 
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities 
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation ;  among  the 
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria ;  among  the 
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis. 
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la- 
hours  of  his  predecessors :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved 
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented 
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this 
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination 
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their 
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing 
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as 
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor 
tion  of  the  length  of  the  ordinate,  and  supposing  the  abscissa 
to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines

more  or  less  diminution  ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba 
ble  :  and,  in  order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of  diminution 
might  be,  he  considered  that  if  the  moon  be  retained  in  her  orbit 
by  the  force  of  gravity,  the  primary  planets  must  also  be  carried 
round  the  sun  by  the  like  power;  and,  by  comparing  the  periods 
of  the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun,  he  found 
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity, 
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in 
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the 
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now 
was  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?  Was  such  a  force,  em 
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to  the  moon,  sufficient,  when 
diminished  as  the  square  of  the  distance,  to  retain  her  in  her 
orbit  ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he  compared  the  space 
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall,  in  a  second  of  time,  at  a  given 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  namely,  at  its  surface,  with 
the  space  through  which  the  moon  falls,  as  it  were,  to  the  earth, 
in  the  same  time,  while  revolving  in  a  circular  orbit.  He  was 
absent  from  books  ;  and,  therefore,  adopted,  in  computing  the 
earth's  diameter,  the  common  estimate  of  sixty  miles  to  a  degree 
of  latitude  as  then  in  use  among  geographers  and  navigators. 
The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex 
pectations  ;  hence,  he  concluded  that  some  other  cause,  beyond  the 
reach  of  observation — analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des 
cartes — joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the 
rnooil.  Though  by  no  means  satisfied,  he  yet  aband
deduce  the  motions  of  the  heavens  a  priori.  Because  the  weights  of 
the  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan 
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest. 
It  is  true,  that  the  action  of  Jupiter  upon  Saturn  is  not  to  be  neglected; 
for  the  force  of  gravity  towards  Jupiter  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  towards 
the  sun  (at  equal  distances,  Cor.  2,  Prop.  VIII)  as  1  to  1067;  and  therefore 
in  the  conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  because  the  distance  of  Saturn 
from  Jupiter  is  to  the  distance  of  Saturn  from  the  sun  almost  as  4  to  9,  the 
gravity  of  Saturn  towards  Jupiter  will  be  to  the  gravity  of  Saturn  towards 
the  sun  as  81  to  16  X  1067;  or,  as  1  to  about  21 1.  And  hence  arises  a 
perturbation  of  the  orb  of  Saturn  in  every  conjunction  of  this  planet  with 
Tupiter,  so  sensible,  that  astronomers  are  puzzled  with  it.  As  the  planet

retarded ;  yet  the  whole  error  in  its  motion  about  the  sun,  though  arising 
from  so  great  a  force,  may  be  almost  avoided  (except  in  the  mean  motion) 
by  placing  the  lower  focus  of  its  orbit  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of 
Jupiter  and  the  sun  (according  to  Prop.  LXVII,  Book  I),  and  therefore  that 
error,  when  it  is  greatest,  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes ;  and  the  greatest 
error  in  the  mean  motion  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes  yearly.  But  in  the 
conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  the  accelerative  forces  of  gravity  of  the 
sun  towards  Saturn,  of  Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  and  of  Jupiter  towards  the 
sun,  are  almost  as  16,  81,  and  -       ~o^~~       — >  or  156609:  and  therefore 
the  difference  of  the  forces  of  gravity  of  the  sun  towards  Saturn,  and  of 
Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  towards  the 
sun  as  65  to  156609,  or  as  1  to  2409.  But  the  greatest  power  of  Saturn 
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of 
Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common 
centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth  and  moon  moves  in  an  ellipsis  about  the  sun 
in  the  focus  thereof,  and,  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun,  describes  areas  pro 
portional  to  the  times  of  description.  But  the  earth  in  the  mean  time  by

the  said  common  laws  of  attraction.  Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies 
to  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance 
from  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop.  XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it 
would  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in 
.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in 
a  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as 
that  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, 
Jupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon 
together  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing 
happens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts 
(p.  75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose.  To  hinder  such  a 
descent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required.  And  hence  depends  the 
force  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the 
planets.  Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of 
their  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de 
scend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded 
by  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the 
former  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths 
would  descend  to  the  sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, 
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor 
become  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are 
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to 
revolve  in  their  orbits,  are  
apparent  geocentric  motion,  we  infer  (by  Prop.  Ill 
Cor.  IV)  that  the  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  turned  out  of  a  rectilinear  course, 
and  made  to  revolve  in  an  orb,  is  not  directed  to  the  centre  of  the  earth. 
And  the  same  argument  holds  good  in  Mars  and  in  Saturn.  Another  centre 
of  these  forces  is  therefore  to  be  looked  for  (by  Prop.  II  and  III,  and  the 
Corollaries  of  the  latter),  about  which  the  areas  described  by  radii  inter 
vening  may  be  equable ;  and  that  this  is  the  sun,  we  have  proved  already 
in  Mars  and  Saturn  nearly,  but  accurately  enough  in  Jupiter.  It  may  be 
alledged  that  the  sun  and  planets  are  impelled  by  some  other  force  equally 
and  in  the  direction  of  parallel  lines ;  but  by  such  a  force  (by  Cor.  VI  of 
the  Laws  of  Motion)  no  change  would  happen  in  the  situation  of  the 
planets  one  to  another,  nor  any  sensible  eifect  follow  :  but  our  business  is 
with  the  causes  of  sensible  effects.  Let  us,  therefore,  neglect  every  such 
force  as  imaginary  and  precarious,  and  of  no  use  in  the  phenomena  of  the 
heavens ;  and  the  whole  remaining  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  impelled  will 
be  directed  (by  Prop.  Ill,  Cor.  I)  to  the  centre  of  the  sun. 
The  distances  of  the  planets  from  the  sun  come  out  the  same,  whether, 
with  Tycho,  we  place  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  system,  or  the  sun  with 
Copernicus  :  and  we  have  already  proved  that  these  distances  are  true  ir.

But  I  should  be  glad  the  diameters  of  the  planets  were  more  accurately 
measured  ;  and  that  may  be  done,  if  a  lamp,  set  at  a  great  distance,  is  made 
to  shine  through  a  circular  hole,  and  both  the  hole  and  the  light  of  the 
lamp  are  so  diminished  that  the  spectrum  may  appear  through  the  telescope 
just  like  the  planet,  and  may  be  defined  by  the  same  measure :  then  the 
diameter  of  the  hole  will  be  to  its  distance  from  the  objective  glass  as  the 
true  diameter  of  the  planet  to  its  distance  from  us.  The  light  of  the  lamp 
may  be  diminished  by  the  interposition  either  of  pieces  of  cloth,  or  of 
smoked  glass. 
Of  kin  to  the  analogy  we  have  been  describing,  there  is  another  observed 
between  the  forces  and  the  bodies  attracted  (p.  395,  396,  397).  Since  the 
action  of  the  centripetal  force  upon  the  planets  decreases  in  the  duplicate 
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it 
was  not  that  the  circum-solar  force  was  equally  exerted  upon  Jupiter  and 
all  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights.  And  the  same  thing 
is  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in

DEFINITION  I. 
77w?  quantity  of  matter  is  the  measure  of  the  same,  arising  from  its 
density  and  hulk  conjutictly. 
THUS  air  of  a  double  density,  in  a  double  space,  is  quadruple  in  quan- 
ti  ty ;  in  a  triple  space,  sextuple  in  quantity.  The  same  thing  is  to  be  un 
derstood  of  snow,  and  fine  dust  or  powders,  that  are  condensed  by  compres 
sion  or  liquefaction  •  and  of  all  bodies  that  are  by  any  causes  whatever 
differently  condensed.  I  have  no  regard  in  this  place  to  a  medium,  if  any 
such  there  is,  that  freely  pervades  the  interstices  between  the  parts  oi 
bodies.  It  is  this  quantity  that  I  mean  hereafter  everywhere  under  the 
name  of  body  or  mass.  And  the  same  is  known  by  the  weight  of  each 
body ;  for  it  is  proportional  to  the  weight,  as  I  have  found  by  experiments 
on  pendulums,  very  accurately  made,  which  shall  be  shewn  hereafter.

The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is 
iouble ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple,

present  stale,  whether  it  be  of  rest,  or  of  moving  uniformly  forward 
in  a  right  line. 
This  force  is  ever  proportional  to  the  body  whose  force  it  is ;  and  differs 
nothing  from  the  inactivity  of  the  mass,  but  in  our  manner  of  conceiving

DEFINITION  VII. 
The  accelerative  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure,  of  tht 
same,  proportional  to  the  velocity  which  it  generates  in  a  given  time. 
Thus  the  force  of  the  same  load-stone  is  greater  at  a  less  distance,  and 
less  at  a  greater :  also  the  force  of  gravity  is  greater  in  valleys,  less  on 
tops  of  exceeding  high  mountains ;  and  yet  less  (as  shall  hereafter  be  shown), 
at  greater  distances  from  the  body  of  the  earth ;  but  at  equal  distan 
ces,  it  is  the  same  everywhere ;  because  (taking  away,  or  allowing  for,  the 
resistance  of  the  air),  it  equally  accelerates  all  falling  bodies,  whether  heavy 
or  light,  great  or  small. 
DEFINITION  VIII. 
TJie  motive  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force,  is  the  measure  of  the  samt\ 
proportional  to  the  motion  which  it  generates  in  a  given  twip. 
Thus  the  weight  is  greater  in  a  greater  body,  less  in  a  less  body ;  and. 
in  the  same  body,  it  is  greater  near  to  the  earth,  and  less  at  remoter  dis 
tances.  This  sort  of  quantity  is  the  centripetency,  or  propension  of  the 
whole  body  towards  the  centre,  or,  as  I  may  say,  its  weight ;  and  it  is  al 
ways  known  by  the  quantity  of  an  equal  and  contrary  force  just  sufficient 
to  Ifinder  the  descent  of  the  body. 
These  quantities  of  forces,  we  may,  for  brevity's  sake,  call  by  the  names 
of  motive,  accelerative,  and  absolute  forces ;  and,  for  distinction's  sake,  con 
sider  them,  with  respect  to  the  bodies  that  tend  to  the  centre ;  to  the  places 
of  those  bodies ;  and  to  the  centre  of  force  towards  which  they  tend  ;  that 
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen 
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the 
sever
able  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. 
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the 
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no 
means  consist  in  such  relations. 
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
y  tend  ;  that 
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen 
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the 
several  parts  taken  together ;  the  accelerative  force  to  the  place  of  the 
body,  as  a  certain  power  or  energy  diffused  from  the  centre  to  all  places 
around  to  move  the  bodies  that  are  in  them :  and  the  absolute  force  to 
the  centre,  as  endued  with  some  cause,  without  which  those  motive  forces 
would  not  be  propagated  through  the  spaces  round  about ;  whether  that 
cause  be  some  central  body  (siuh  as  is  the  load-stone,  in  the  centre  of  the 
magnetic  force,  or  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  gravitating  force),  or 
anything  else  that  does  not  yet  appear.  For  I  here  design  only  to  give  a 
mathematical  notion  of  those  forces,  without  considering  their  physical 
causes  and  seats. 
Wherefore  the  accelerative  force  will  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  the 
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

because  the  force  with  which  the  weight  p  presses  the  plane  pQi  is  to  the 
force  with  which  the  same,  whether  by  its  own  gravity,  or  by  the  blow  of 
a  mallet,  is  impelled  in  the  direction  of  the  line  joH  towards  both  the 
planes,  as  joN  to  pH ;  and  to  the  force  with  which  it  presses  the  other 
plane  pG,  as  joN  to  NH.  And  thus  the  force  of  the  screw  may  be  deduced 
from  a  like  resolution  of  forces ;  it  being  no  other  than  a  wedge  impelled 
with  the  force  of  a  lever.  Therefore  the  use  of  this  Corollary  spreads  far 
and  wide,  and  by  that  diffusive  extent  the  truth  thereof  is  farther  con 
firmed.  For  on  what  has  been  said  depends  the  whole  doctrine  of  mechan 
ics  variously  demonstrated  by  different  authors.  For  from  hence  are  easily 
deduced  the  forces  of  machines,  which  are  compounded  of  wheels,  pullics, 
levers,  cords,  and  weights,  ascending  directly  or  obliquely,  and  other  mechan 
ical  powers ;  as  also  the  force  of  the  tendons  to  move  the  bones  of  animals. 
COROLLARY  III. 
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves. 
For  action  and  its  opposite  re-action  are  equal,  by  Law  III,  and  there 
fore,  by  Law  II,  they  produce  in  the  motions  equal  changes  towards  oppo 
site  parts.  Therefore  if  the  motions  are  directed  towards  the  same  parts. 
whatever  is  added  to  the  motion  of  the  preceding  body  will  be  subducted 
from  the  motion  of  that  which  follows  ;  so  that  the  sum  will  be  the  same 
as  before.  If  the  bodies  meet,  with  contrary  motions,  there  will  be  an

AXIOMS,  OR  LAWS  OF  MOTION. 
LAW  I. 
Hvery  body  perseveres  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  uniform  motion  in  a  ri^ht 
line,  unless  it  is  compelled  to  change  that  state  by  forces  impressed 
thereon. 
PROJECTILES  persevere  in  their  motions,  so  far  as  they  are  not  retarded 
by  the  resistance  of  the  air,  or  impelled  downwards  by  the  force  of  gravity 
A  top,  whose  parts  by  their  cohesion  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from 
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its  rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it  is  re 
tarded  by  the  air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  meeting 
with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro 
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time. 
LAW   II. 
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus 
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force 
is  impressed. 
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both. 
LAW  III. 
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction :  or  the  mu 
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di 
rected  to  contrary  parts. 
Whatever  draws  or  presses  another  is  as  much  drawn  or  pressed  by  that 
other.  If  you  press  a  stone 
roblem ;  7 
move  a  given  weight  with  a  given  power,  or  with  a  given  force  to  over 
come  any  other  given  resistance.  For  if  machines  are  so  contrived  that  the 
velocities  of  the  agent  and  resistant  are  reciprocally  as  their  forces,  the 
agent  will  just  sustain  the  resistant,  but  with  a  greater  disparity  of  ve 
locity  will  overcome  it.  So  that  if  the  disparity  of  velocities  is  so  great 
as  to  overcome  all  that  resistance  which  commonly  arises  either  from  the 
attrition  of  contiguous  bodies  as  they  slide  by  one  another,  or  from  the 
cohesion  of  continuous  bodies  that  are  to  be  separated,  or  from  the  weights 
of  bodies  to  be  raised,  the  excess  of  the  force  remaining,  after  all  those  re 
sistances  are  overcome,  will  produce  an  acceleration  of  motion  proportional 
thereto,  as  well  in  the  parts  of  {he  machine  as  in  the  resisting  body.  But 
to  treat  of  mechanics  is  not  my  present  business.  I  was  only  willing  to 
show  by  those  examples  the  great  extent  and  certainty  of  the  third  Law  ot 
motion.  For  if  we  estimate  the  action  of  the  agent  from  its  force  and

V:  INTRODUCTION    TO 
set  up.  The  PRINCIPIA,  above  all,  glows  with  the  immortality  of 
a  transcendant  mind.  Marble  and  brass  dissolve  and  pass  away  ; 
but  the  true  creations  of  genius  endure,  in  time  and  beyond  time, 
forever  :  high  upon  the  adamant  of  the  indestructible,  they  send 
forth  afar  and  near,  over  the  troublous  waters  of  life,  a  pure,  un 
wavering,  quenchless  light  whereby  the  myriad  myriads  of  barques, 
richly  laden  with  reason,  intelligence  and  various  faculty,  are 
guided  through  the  night  and  the  storm,  by  the  beetling  shore 
and  the  hidden  rock,  the  breaker  and  the  shoal,  safely  into  havens 
calm  and  secure. 
To  the  teacher  and  the  taught,  the  scholar  and  the  student,  the 
devotee  of  Science  and  the  worshipper  of  Truth,  the  PRINCIPIA 
must  ever  continue  to  be  of  inestimable  value.  If  to  educate 
means,  not  so  much  to  store  the  memory  with  symbols  and  facts, 
as  to  bring  forth  the  faculties  of  the  soul  and  develope  them  to  the 
full  by  healthy  nurture  and  a  hardy  discipline,  then,  what  so  effec 
tive  to  the  accomplishment  of  that  end  as  the  study  of  Geometri 
cal  Synthesis  ?  The  Calculus,  in  some  shape  or  other,  is,  indeed, 
necessary  to  the  successful  prosecution  of  researches  in  the  higher 
branches  of  philosophy.  But  has  not  the  Analytical  encroached 
upon  the  Synthetical,  and  Algorithmic  Formulae  been  employed 
when  not  requisite,  either  for  the  evolution  of  truth,  or  even  its 
apter  illustration  ?  To  each  method  belongs,  undoubtedly,  an 
appropriate  use.  Newton,  himself  the  inventor  of  Fluxions, 
censured  the  handling  of  Geometrical  subjects  by  Algebraical 
calculations  ;  and  the  maturest  opinions  which  he  expressed  were 
additionally  in  favour  of  the  Geometrical  Method.  His  prefer 
ence,  so  st
 book  was  sent  to  the  Society,  and  presented  on  the 
2d  March  ;  the  third,  on  the  6th  April ;  and  the  whole  was  com 
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but 
its  algorithm  or  notation  did  not  appear  till  published  in  the 
second  volume  nf  Dr.  Wallis's  works,  in  1693. 
And  thus  was  ushered  into  existence  The  PRINCIPIA — a  work 
to  which  pre-eminence  above  all  the  productions  of  the  human 
intellect  has  been  awarded — a  work  that  must  be  esteemed  of 
priceless  worth  so  long  as  Science  has  a  votary,  or  a  single  wor 
shipper  be  left  to  kneel  at  the  altar  of  Truth.
NING  THE  FORM  OF  THE  MOST  ANCIENT 
^EAR,  closes  this  enumeration  of  his  Chronological  Writings. 
A  ihird  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  appeared  in  1726,  with  many 
changes  and  additions.  About  four  years  were  consumed  in  its 
preparation  and  publication,  which  were  under  the  superintend- 
ance  of  Dr.  Henry  Pemberton,  an  accomplished  mathematician, 
and  the  author  of  "A  VIEW  OF  SIR  ISAAC  NEWTON'S  PHILO 
SOPHY."  1728.  This  gentleman  enjoyed  numerous  opportunities 
of  conversing  with  the  aged  and  illustrious  author.  "  I  found," 
says  Pemberton,  "  he  had  read  fewer  of  the  modern  mathemati 
cians  than  one  could  have  expected;  but  his  own  prodigious 
invention  readily  supplied  him  with  what  he  might  have  an  occa 
sion  for  in  the  pursuit  of  any  subject  he  undertook.  I  have  often

and  to  teach,  and  so  render  himself,  not  the  "ornament"  cnly; 
but  inconceivably  more,  the  pre-eminent  benefactor  of  his  species. 
The  honour  of  knighthood  v/as  conferred  on  our  author  in 
1705.  Soon  afterward,  he  was  a  candidate  again  for  the  Repre 
sentation  of  the  University,  but  was  defeated  by  a  large  majority. 
It  is  thought  that  a  more  pliant  man  was  preferred  by  both  min 
isters  and  electors.  Newton  was  always  remarkable  for  simplicity 
of  dress,  and  his  only  known  departure  from  it  was  on  this  oc 
casion,  when  he  is  said  to  have  appeared  in  a  suit  of  laced 
clothes. 
The  Algebraical  Lectures  which  he  had,  Juring  nine  years, 
delivered  at  Cambridge,  were  published  by  Whiston,  in  1707, 
under  the  title  of  ARITHMETICS  UNIVERSALIS,  SINE  DE  COMPOSI 
TIONS  ET  RESOLUTIONS  ARITHMETICA  LIBER.  This  publication 
is  said  to  have  been  a  breach  of  confidence  on  Whiston's  part.  Mr. 
Ralphson,  not  long  afterward,  translated  the  work  into  English ; 
and  a  second  edition  of  it,  with  improvements  by  the  author,  was 
issued  at  London,  1712,  by  Dr.  Machin.  Subsequent  editions, 
both  in  English  and  Latin,  with  commentaries,  have  been  published. 
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro 
fessor  of  Astronomy  at  Cambridge.  The  first  edition  had  been 
sold  off  for  some  time.  Copies  of  the  work  had  become  very 
rare,  and  could  only  be  obtained  at  several  times  their  original 
cost.  A  great  number  of  letters  passed  oetween  the  author  and 
Mr.  Cotes  during  the  preparation  of  the  edition,  which  finally 
appeared  in  May,  1713.  It  had  many  alterations  and  improve 
ments,  and  was  accompanied  by  an  admirable  Preface  from  the

turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed
14  LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON 
His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven 
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor 
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes 
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his 
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New 
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug 
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669. 
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ; 
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis 
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science, 
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name. 
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method 
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities 
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation ;  among  the 
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria ;  among  the 
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis. 
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la- 
hours  of  his  predecessors :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved 
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented 
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this 
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination 
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their 
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing 
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as 
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor 
tion  of  the  length  of  the  ordinate,  and  supposing  the  abscissa 
to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines

"  I.  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  in  London  in  the  beginning  of  the  year 
1673  ;  and  went  thence  in  or  about  March,  to  Paris,  where  he 
kept  a  correspondence  with  Mr.  Collins,  by  means  of  Mr.  Olden 
burg,  till  about  September,  1676,  and  then  returned,  by  London 
and  Amsterdam,  to  Hanover:  and  that  Mr.  Collins  was  very  free 
in  communicating  to  able  mathematicians  what  he  had  received 
from  Mr,  Newton  and  Mr.  Gregory. 
"  II.  That  when  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  the  first  time  in  London, 
he  contended  for  the  invention  of  another  differential  method, 
properly  so  called  ;  and,  notwithstanding  he  was  shown  by  Dr. 
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other 
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of 
June,  1677,  which  was  a  year  after  a  copy  of  Mr.  Newton's  letter 
of  the  10th  of  December,  1672,  had  been  sent  to  Paris  to  be 
communicated  to  him ;  and  above  four  years  after  Mr.  Collins 
began  to  communicate  that  letter  to  his  correspondents  ;  in  which 
letter  the  method  of  fluxions  was  sufficiently  described  to  any 
intelligent  person. 
"III.  That  by  Mr.  Newton's  letter,  of  the  13th  of  June,  1676 
it  appears  that  he  had  the  method  of  fluxions  above  five  years 
before  the  writing  of  that  letter.  And  by  his  Analysis  per  ^Equa- 
tiones  numero  Terminorum  Infmitas,  communicated  by  Dr.  Barrow 
to  Mr.  Collins,  in  July,  1669,  we  find  that  he  had  invented  the 
method  before  that  time.

the  method  of  fluxions,

The  bodies,  by  the  last  Theorem,  will  be  moved  in  the  same  manner  as 
if  they  were  attracted  by  a  third  placed  in  the  common  centre  of  their 
gravity ;  and  by  the  hypothesis  that  centre  will  be  quiescent  at  the  begin 
ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the 
bodies  attracting  each  other  mutually.  Q.E.I.

PROPOSITION  VIII.     THEOREM   VIII. 
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of 
the  particles  are  unequal,  and  their  situation  dissimilar.     But  by  the  help 
of  Prop.  LXXV  and  LXXVI,  Book  I,  and  their  Corollaries,  I  was  at  last 
satisfied  of  the  truth  of  the  Proposition,  as  it  now  lies  before  us. 
COR.  1.  Hence  we  may  find  and  compare  together  the  weights  of  bodies 
towards  different  planets  ;  for  the  weights  of  bodies  revolving  in  circles 
about  planets  are  (by  Cor.  2,  Prop.  IV,  Book  I)  as  the  diameters  of  the 
circles  directly,  and  the  squares  of  their  periodic  times  reciprocally ;  and 
their  weights  at  the  surfaces  of  the  planets,  or  at  any  other  distances  from 
their  centres,  are  (by  this  Prop.)  greater  or  less  in  the  reciprocal  duplicate 
proportion  of  the  distances.  Thus  from  the  periodic  times  of  Venus,  re

COR.  5.  The  power  of  gravity  is  of  a  different  nature  from  the  power  of 
magnetism  ;  for  the  magnetic  attraction  is  not  as  the  matter  attracted. 
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by  the  magnet ;  others  less ;  most  bodies 
not  at  all.  The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be 
increased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity 
of  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet 
decreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the 
distance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. 
PROPOSITION  VII.     THEOREM  VII. 
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to 
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. 
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law 
III)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  par

more  or  less  diminution  ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba 
ble  :  and,  in  order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of  diminution 
might  be,  he  considered  that  if  the  moon  be  retained  in  her  orbit 
by  the  force  of  gravity,  the  primary  planets  must  also  be  carried 
round  the  sun  by  the  like  power;  and,  by  comparing  the  periods 
of  the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun,  he  found 
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity, 
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in 
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the 
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now 
was  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?  Was  such  a  force,  em 
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to  the  moon,  sufficient,  when 
diminished  as  the  square  of  the  distance,  to  retain  her  in  her 
orbit  ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he  compared  the  space 
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall,  in  a  second  of  time,  at  a  given 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  namely,  at  its  surface,  with 
the  space  through  which  the  moon  falls,  as  it  were,  to  the  earth, 
in  the  same  time,  while  revolving  in  a  circular  orbit.  He  was 
absent  from  books  ;  and,  therefore,  adopted,  in  computing  the 
earth's  diameter,  the  common  estimate  of  sixty  miles  to  a  degree 
of  latitude  as  then  in  use  among  geographers  and  navigators. 
The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex 
pectations  ;  hence,  he  concluded  that  some  other  cause,  beyond  the 
reach  of  observation — analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des 
cartes — joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the 
rnooil.  Though  by  no  means  satisfied,  he  yet  aband
 by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
  another  force  different  from  that, 
then  bodies  descending  to  the  earth  with  the  joint  impulse  of  both  forces 
would  fall  with  a  double  velocity,  and  in  the  space  of  one  second  of  time 
would  describe  30^  Paris  feet ;  altogether  against  experience. 
This  calculus  is  founded  on  the  hypothesis  of  the  earth's  standing  still ; 
for  if  both  earth  and  moon  move  about  the  sun.  and  at  the  same  time  about 
their  common  centre  of  gravity,  the  distance  of  the  centres  of  the  moon  and 
earth  from  one  another  will  be  6(H  semi-diameters  of  the  earth  ;  as  may 
be  found  by  a  computation  from  Prop.  LX,  Book  I. 
SCHOLIUM. 
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by 
the  foregoing  computation.  Therefore  if  the  same  little  moon  should  be 
deserted  by  its  centrifugal  force  that  carries  it  through  its  orb,  and  so  be
upon  Jupiter  and 
all  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights.  And  the  same  thing 
is  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in  re 
spect  of  the  moon,  as  appears  from  Cor.  II  and  III,  Prop.  LXV.  Arid, 
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for 
if  the  action  was  greater  upon  some  sort  of  particles  than  upon  others  than 
in  proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter,  it  would  be  also  greater  or  less 
upon  the  whole  planets  not  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  only,  but  like 
wise  of  the  sort  of  the  matter  more  copiously  found  in  one  and  more 
sparingly  in  another. 
In  such  bodies  as  are  found  on  our  earth  of  very  different  sorts,  I  exam 
ined  this  analogy  with  great  accuracy  (p.  343,  344). 
If  the  action  of  the  circum-terrestrial  force  is  proportional  to  the  bodies 
to  be  moved,  it  will  (by  the  Second  Law  of  Motion)  move  them  with  equal 
velocity  in  equal  times,  and  will  make  all  bodies  let  fall  to  descend  through 
equal  spaces  in  equal  times,  and  all  bodies  hung  by  equal  threads  to  vibrate 
in  equal  times.  If  the  action  of  the  force  was  greater,  the  times  would  be 
less ;  if  that  was  less,  these  would  be  greater. 
But  it  has  been  long  ago  observed  by  others,  that  (allowance  being  made 
for  the  small  resistance  of  the  air)  all  bodies  descend  through  equal  spaces
 ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth. 
RULE  IV. 
In  experimental  philosophy  we  are  to  look  upon  propositions  collected  by 
general  induction  from,  phenomena  as  accurately  or  very  nearly  true, 
notwithstanding  any  contrary  hypotheses  that  may  be  imagined,  till 
such  time  as  other  phenomena  occur,  by  which  they  may  either  be  made 
more  accurate,  or  liable  to  exceptions. 
This  rule  we  must  follow,  that  the  argument  of  induction  may  not  bf 
evaded  by  hypotheses.

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to 
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min 
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  t
ion  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  part  will  be  to  the  gravity  towards  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole.  Q.E.D. 
COR,  1.  Therefore  the  force  of  gravity  towards  any  whole  planet  arises 
from,  and  is  compounded  of,  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its  parts. 
Magnetic  and  electric  attractions  afford  us  examples  of  this ;  for  all  at 
traction  towards  the  whole  arises  from  the  attractions  towards  the  several 
parts.  The  thing  may  be  easily  understood  in  gravity,  if  we  consider  a 
greater  planet,  as  formed  of  a  number  of  lesser  planets,  meeting  together  in 
one  globe ;  for  hence  it  would  appear  that  the  force  of  the  whole  must 
arise  from  the  forces  of  the  component  parts.  If  it  is  objected,  that,  ac 
cording  to  this  law,  all  bodies  with  us  must  mutually  gravitate  one  to 
wards  another,  whereas  no  such  gravitation  any  where  appears,  I  answer, 
that  since  the  gravitation  towards  these  bodies  is  to  the  gravitation  towards 
the  whole  earth  as  these  bodies  are  to  the  whole  earth,  the  gravitation  to 
wards  them  must  be  far  less  than  to  fall  under  the  observation  of  our  senses. 
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
BOOK  Ill.J  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.  397 
By  bodies  of  the  same  density,  I  mean  those  whose  vires  inertia  are  in  the 
proportion  of  their  bulks. 
COR.  5.  The  power  of  gravity  is  of  a  different  nature  from  the  power  of 
magnetism  ;  for  the  magnetic  attraction  is  not  as  the  matter  attracted. 
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by  the  magnet ;  others  less ;  most  bodies 
not  at  all.  The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be 
increased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity 
of  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet 
decreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the 
distance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. 
PROPOSITION  VII.     THEOREM  VII. 
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to 
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. 
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law 
III)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  par
  first  Sections  of  the  first  Book.  He  may  then  pass  on  to 
this  Book,  and  consult  such  of  the  remaining  Propositions  of  the 
first  two  Books,  as  the  references  in  this,  and  his  occasions  shall  re 
quire."  So  that  "  The  System  of  the  World"  is  composed  both 
"  in  a  popular  method,"  and  in  the  form  of  mathematical  Propo 
sitions. 
The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other 
particle  of  matter,  icith  a  force  inversely  proportional  to  the 
squares  of  their  distances — is  the  discovery  w?  ich  characterizes 
The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo 
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true. 
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
h 
this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi 
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have 
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines. 
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the 
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy. 
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved 
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which 
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but 
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, 
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, 
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht 
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. 
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1), 
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the 
planets. 
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de 
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an 
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces 
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for
396  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK  II] 
planet  are  one  to  another  as  the  matter  in  the  several  parts;  for  if  some 
parts  did  gravitate  more,  others  less,  than  for  the  quantity  of  their  matter, 
then  the  whole  planet,  according  to  the  sort  of  parts  with  which  it  most 
abounds,  would  gravitate  more  or  less  than  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of 
matter  in  the  whole.  Nor  is  it  of  any  moment  whether  these  parts  are 
external  or  internal ;  for  if,  for  example,  we  should  imagine  the  terrestrial 
bodies  with  us  to  be  raised  up  to  the  orb  of  the  moon,  to  be  there  compared 
with  its  body  :  if  the  weights  of  such  bodies  were  to  the  weights  of  the  ex 
ternal  parts  of  the  moon  as  the  quantities  of  matter  in  the  one  and  in  the 
other  respectively  •  but  to  the  weights  of  the  internal  parts  in  a  greater  or 
less  proportion,  then  likewise  the  weights  of  those  bodies  would  be  to  the 
weight  of  the  whole  moon  in  a  greater  or  less  proportion;  against  what 
we  have  shewed  above. 
COR.  1.  Hence  the  weights  of  bodies  do  not  depend  upon  their  forms 
and  textures  ;  for  if  the  weights  could  be  altered  with  the  forms,  they 
would  be  greater  or  less,  according  to  the  variety  of  forms,  in  equal  matter ; 
altogether  against  experience. 
COR.  2.  Universally,  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the 
earth ;  and  the  weights  of  all,  at  equal  distances  from  the  earth's  centre. 
are  as  the  quantities  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain.  This  is  the 
quality  of  all  bodies  within  the  reach  of  our  experiments  ;  and  therefore 
(by  Rule  III)  to  be  affirmed  of  all  bodies  whatsoever.  If  the  ather,  or  anj 
other  body,  were  either  altogether  void  of  gravity,  or  were  to  gravitate  lesr 
in  proportion  to  its  quantit

so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a 
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won 
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies." 
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be 
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred 
years  before  this  memorable  birth. 
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com 
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with 
small  one  which  she  possessed  at  Sewstern,  in  Leicestershire,  yield 
ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum, 
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa 
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years, 
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care 
of  her  own  mother. 
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; 
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at 
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. 
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- 
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary. 
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con 
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no 
charms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the 
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem 
ingly  dull  student  gave  him  a  severe  
60  LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON. 
years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled ;  and,  in 
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}' 
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity. 
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state 
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most 
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal 
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu 
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean 
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the 
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid, 
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably 
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was 
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge. 
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who 
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose. 
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand 
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces 
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve 
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern 
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father 
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable 
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the 
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit ;  and  the  other, 
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit, 
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con 
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he 
had  dischar

chiefly,  in  the  possession  of  the  family  of  the  Earl  of  Portsmouth, 
through  the  Viscountess  Lymington. 
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che 
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are 
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the 
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  Edinburgh. 
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke 
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in 
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: — " 'Tis  built  of  stone, 
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good 
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-, 
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger 
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University. 
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of 
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down 
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr 
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir 
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple- 
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned 
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed 
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved 
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with 
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white 
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the 
follow, ng  inscription  : — 
"  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  son  of  John  Newton,  Lord  of  the  Manor 
of  Woolsthorpe,  was  born  in  this  room,  on  the  25th  of  December,

turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed

of  discovery — the  stirring  elements  of  that  wondrous  spirit, 
which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through 
deep  onward  through  deep  of  Nature's  mysteries,  unlocking  her 
strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere  si 
lently  conquering. 
Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures, 
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn, 
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He 
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making 
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated, 
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early 
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She 
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe ;  but 
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham. 
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same 
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per 
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the 
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed, 
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune 
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar 
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated 
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and 
kindness. 
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took 
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen 
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, 
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him 
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage 
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When

It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver 
sion,  we  find,  underlying  his  whole  character  and  running  parallel 
with  all  his  discoveries,  that  extraordinary  humility  which  always 
preserved  him  in  a  position  so  relatively  just  to  the  behests  of 
time  and  eternity,  that  the  infinite  value  of  truth,  and  the  utter 
worthlessness  of  fame,  were  alike  constantly  present  to  him. 
Judging  of  his  course,  however,  in  its  more  temporary  aspect,  as 
bearing  upon  his  immediate  quiet,  it  seemed  the  most  unfortunate. 
For  an  early  publication,  especially  in  the  case  of  his  Method  of 
Fluxions,  would  have  anticipated  all  rivalry,  and  secured  him 
from  the  contentious  claims  of  Leibnitz.  Still  each  one  will  solve 
the  problem  of  his  existence  in  his  own  way,  and,  with  a  manlike 
Newton,  his  own,  as  we  conceive,  could  be  no  other  than  the  best 
way.  The  conduct  of  Leibnitz  in  this  affair  is  quite  irreconcilable 
with  the  stature  and  strength  of  the  man ;  giant-like,  and  doing 
nobly,  in  many  ways,  a  giant's  work,  yet  cringing  himself  into  the 
dimensions  and  performances  of  a  common  calumniator.  Opening 
in  1699,  the  discussion  in  question  continued  till  the  close  of 
Leibnitz's  life,  in  1716.  We  give  the  summary  of  the  case  as

Nec  fas  est  proprius  mortal?  attingere  Divos. — HALLEY. 
FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling 
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control 
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din 
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and 
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and 
moral  truth ;  ascending  height  after  height ;  sweeping  afar  over 
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en 
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly 
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose, 
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its 
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous 
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo 
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis 
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect 
God. 
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain, 
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De 
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the 
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New 
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his 
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi 
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the 
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and 
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness, 
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise 
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life
se  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common. 
I.  Absolute,  true,  and  mathematical  time,  of  itself,  and  from  its  own  na 
ture  flows  equably  without  regard  to  anything  external,  and  by  another 
name  is  called  duration  :  relative,  apparent,  and  common  time,  is  some  sen 
sible  and  external  (whether  accurate  or  unequable)  measure  of  duration  by 
the  means  of  motion,  which  is  commonly  used  instead  of  true  time ;  such 
as  an  hour,  a  day,  a  month,  a  year. 
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which

tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter. 
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions. 
But  because  the  parts  of  space  cannot  be  seen,  or  distinguished  from  one 
another  by  our  senses,  therefore  in  their  stead  we  use  sensible  measures  of 
them.  For  from  the  positions  and  distances  of  things  from  any  body  con 
sidered  as  immovable,  we  define  all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such 
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some 
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absol
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, 
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is 
really  at  rest,  the  body,  which  relatively  rests  in  the  ship,  will  really  and 
absolutely  move  with  the  same  velocity  which  the  ship  has  on  the  earth. 
But  if  the  earth  also  moves,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  the  body  will 
arise,  partly  from  the  true  motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space ;  partly 
from  the  relative  motion  of  the  ship  on  the  earth ;  and  if  the  body  moves 
also  relatively  in  the  ship ;  its  true  motion  will  arise,  partly  from  the  true 
motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space,  and  partly  from  the  relative  mo 
tions  as  well  of  the  ship  on  the  earth,  as  of  the  body  in  the  ship  ;  and  from 
these  relative  motions  will  arise  the  relative  motion  of  the  body  on  the 
earth.     As  if  that  part  of  the  earth,  where  the  ship  is,  was  truly  moved 
toward  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10010  parts;  while  the  ship  itself,  with 
a  fresh  gale,  and  full  sails,  is  carried  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  ex 
pressed  by  10  of  those  parts  ;  but  a  sailor  walks  in  the  ship  towards  the 
east,  with  1  part  of  the  said  velocity ;  then  the  sailor  will  be  moved  truly 
in  immovable  space  towards  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10001  parts,  and 
relatively  on  the  earth  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  of  9  of  those  parts. 
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motion
able  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. 
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the 
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no 
means  consist  in  such  relations. 
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the

absolutely  understood,  it  will  be  perpetually  mutable. 
III.  Place  is  a  part  of  space  which  a  body  takes  up,  and  is  according  to 
the  space,  either  absolute  or  relative.   I  say,  a  part  of  space ;  not  the  situation, 
nor  the  external  surface  of  the  body.     For  the  places  of  equal  solids  are 
always  equal ;  but  their  superfices,  by  reason  of  their  dissimilar  figures,  are 
often  unequal.     Positions  properly  have  no  quantity,  nor  are  they  so  much 
the  places  themselves,  as  the  properties  of  places.     The  motion  of  the  whole 
is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  the  parts ;  that  is,  the 
translation  of  the  whole,  out  of  its  place,  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum 
of  the  translations  of  the  parts  out  of  their  places ;  and  therefore  the  place 
of  the  whole  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  places  of  the  parts,  and 
for  that  reason,  it  is  internal,  and  in  the  whole  body. 
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the 
ship,  or  of  its  cavity.     But  real,  absolute  rest,  is  the  continuance  of  the 
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, 
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is 
really  at  rest,  th
all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such 
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some 
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absolute  places  and  motions, 
we  use  relative  ones;  and  that  without  any  inconvenience  in  common  af 
fairs  ;  but  in  philosophical  disquisitions,  we  ought  to  abstract  from  our 
senses,  and  consider  things  themselves,  distinct  from  what  are  only  sensible 
measures  of  them.  For  it  may  be  that  there  is  no  body  really  at  rest,  to 
which  the  places  and  motions  of  others  may  be  referred. 
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions. 
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

LAW  I. 
Hvery  body  perseveres  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  uniform  motion  in  a  ri^ht 
line,  unless  it  is  compelled  to  change  that  state  by  forces  impressed 
thereon.

A  top,  whose  parts  by  their  cohesion  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from 
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its  rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it  is  re 
tarded  by  the  air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  meeting 
with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro 
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time. 
LAW   II. 
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus 
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force 
is  impressed. 
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both. 
LAW  III. 
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction :  or  the  mu 
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di 
rected  to  contrary  parts.

Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to 
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min 
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  t
  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves. 
From  comparing  the  forces  of  the  planets  one  with  another,  we  have 
above  seen  that  the  circum-solar  does  more  than  a  thousand  times  exceed 
all  the  rest ;  but  by  the  action  of  a  force  so  greab  it  is  unavoidable  but  that 
all  bodies  within,  nay,  and  far  beyond,  the  bounds  of  the  planetary  system 
must  descend  directly  to  the  sun,  unless  by  other  motions  they  are  impelled 
towards  other  parts :  nor  is  our  earth  to  be  excluded  from  the  number  of 
such  bodies :  for  certainly  the  moon  is  a  body  of  the  same  nature  with  the 
planets,  and  subject  to  the  same  attractions  with  the  other  planets,  seeing 
it  is  by  the  circum-terrestrial  force  that  it  is  retained  in  its  orbit.  But 
that  the  earth  and  moon  are  equally  attracted  towards  the  sun,  we  have 
above  proved ;  we  have  likewise  before  proved  that  all  bodies  are  subject  to
530 
THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. 
the  said  common  laws  of  attraction.  Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies 
to  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance 
from  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop.  XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it 
would  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in 
.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in 
a  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as 
that  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, 
Jupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon 
together  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing 
happens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts 
(p.  75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose.  To  hinder  such  a 
descent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required.  And  hence  depends  the 
force  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the 
planets.  Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of 
their  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de 
scend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded 
by  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the 
former  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths 
would  descend  to  the  sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, 
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor 
become  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are 
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to 
revolve  in  their  orbits,  are  
102  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III 
the  sun.  In  other  cases,  the  distances  of  those  centres  are  always  less :  and 
therefore,  since  that  centre  of  gravity  is  in  perpetual  rest,  the  sun,  accord 
ing  to  the  various  positions  of  the  planets,  must  perpetually  be  moved  every 
way,  but  will  never  recede  far  from  that  centre. 
Con.  Hence  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth,  the  sun,  and  all 
the  planets,  is  to  be  esteemed  the  centre  of  the  world ;  for  since  the  earth, 
the  sun,  and  all  the  planets,  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  and 
are  therefore,  according  to  their  powers  of  gravity,  in  perpetual  agitation, 
as  the  Laws  of  Motion  require,  it  is  plain  that  their  moveable  centres  can 
not  be  taken  for  the  immovable  centre  of  the  world.  If  that  body  were  to 
be  placed  in  the  centre,  towards  which  other  bodies  gravitate  most  (accord 
ing  to  common  opinion),  that  privilege  ought  to  be  allowed  to  the  sun;  but 
since  the  sun  itself  is  moved,  a  fixed  point  is  to  be  chosen  from  which  the 
centre  of  the  sun  recedes  least,  and  from  which  it  would  recede  yet 
less  if  the  body  of  the  sun  were  denser  and  greater,  and  therefore  less  apt 
to  be  moved. 
PROPOSITION  XIII.     THEOREM  XIII. 
The  planets  move  in  ellipses  tvhicli  have  their  common  focus  in  the  centre 
of  the  sini  ;  and,  by  radii  drawn,  to  tJtat  centre,  they  describe  areas  pro 
portion  al  to  the  times  of  description. 
We  have  discoursed  above  of  these  motions  from  the  Phenomena.  Now 
that  we  know  the  principles  on  which  they  depend,  from  those  principles 
we  deduce  the  motions  of  the  heavens  a  priori.  Because  the  weights  of 
the  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan 
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,

the  lower  apsis  with  an  angular  motion  of  180  deg.,  45  min.,  44  sec  ,  and 
this  angular  motion  being  repeated,  will  return  to  the  upper  apsis ;  and 
therefore  the  upper  apsis  in  each  revolution  will  go  forward  1  deg.,  31  min.,

So  much  for  the  motion  of  bodies  in  orbits  whose  planes  pass  through 
the  centre  of  force.  It  now  remains  to  determine  those  motions  in  eccen 
trical  planes.  For  those  authors  who  treat  of  the  motion  of  heavy  bodies 
used  to  consider  the  ascent  and  descent  of  such  bodies,  not  only  in  a  per 
pendicular  direction,  but  at  all  degrees  of  obliquity  upon  any  given  planes  ; 
and  for  the  same  reason  we  are  to  consider  in  this  place  the  motions  of 
bodies  tending  to  centres  by  means  of  any  forces  whatsoever,  when  those 
bodies  move  in  eccentrical  planes.  These  planes  are  supposed  to  be 
perfectly  smooth  and  polished,  so  as  not  to  retard  the  motion  of  the  bodies 
in  the  least.  Moreover,  in  these  demonstrations,  instead  of  the  planes  upon

356  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BoOK    11. 
Projectiles  excite  a  motion  in  fluids  as  they  pass  through  them,  and  this 
motion  arises  from  the  excess  of  the  pressure  of  the  fluid  at  the  fore  parts 
of  the  projectile  above  the  pressure  of  the  same  at  the  hinder  parts :  and 
cannot  be  less  in  mediums  infinitely  fluid  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  quick 
silver,  in  proportion  to  the  density  of  matter  in  each.  Now  this  excess  of 
pressure  does,  in  proportion  to  its  quantity,  not  only  excite  a  motion  in  the 
fluid,  but  also  acts  upon  the  projectile  so  as  to  retard  its  motion  ;  and  there 
fore  the  resistance  in  every  fluid  is  as  the  motion  excited  by  the  projectile 
in  the  fluid ;  and  cannot  be  less  in  the  most  subtile  aether  in  proportion  to 
the  density  of  that  aether,  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  Quicksilver,  in  pro 
portion  to  the  densities  of  those  fluids.

A  pressure  is  not  propagated  through  a  fluid  in  rectilinear  directions 
unless  ichere  the  particles  of  the  fluid  lie  in  a  right  line. 
If  the  particles  a,  b}  c,  d,  e,  lie  in  a  right  line,  the  pres 
sure  may  be  indeed  directly  propagated  from  a  to  e  ;  but 
then  the  particle  e  will  urge  the  obliquely  posited  parti

not  sustain  this  pressure,  unless  they  be  supported  by  the 
particles  h  and  k  lying  beyond  them ;  but  the  particles 
that  support  them  are  also  pressed  by  them ;  and  those  particles  cannot 
sustain  that  pressure,  without  being  supported  by,  and  pressing  upon,  those 
particles  that  lie  still  farther,  as  /  and  m,  and  so  on  in  itiflnitum.  There

And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving 
in  any  fluids  whatsoever,  though  of  the  most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris 
paribus,  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids. 
These  things  being  thus  established,  we  may  now  determine  what  part 
of  its  motion  any  globe  projected  in  any  fluid  whatsoever  would  nearly  lose 
in  a  given  time.  Let  D  be  the  diameter  of  the  globe,  and  V  its  velocity 
at  the  beginning  of  its  motion,  and  T  the  time  in  which  a  globe  with  the 
velocity  V  can  describe  in  vacua  a  space  that  is,  to  the  space  |D  as  the 
density  of  the  globe  to  the  density  of  the  fluid  ;  and  the  globe  projected

logarithm  of  the  number  — ~ —  multiplied  by  the  number  2,302585093  is 
to  the  number  7^,  by  Cor.  7,  Prop.  XXXV.  In  slow  motions  the  resist 
ance  may  be  a  little  less,  because  the  figure  of  a  globe  is  more  adapted  to 
motion  than  the  figure  of  a  cylinder  described  with  the  same  diameter.  In 
swift  motions  the  resistance  may  be  a  little  greater,  because  the  elasticity 
and  compression  of  the  fluid  do  not  increase  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
velocity.  But  these  little  niceties  I  take  no  notice  of. 
And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in

SCHOLIUM. 
The  resistance  of  spherical  bodies  in  fluids  arises  partly  from  the  tena 
city,  partly  from  the  attrition,  and  partly  from  the  density  of  the  medium. 
And  that  part  of  the  resistance  which  arises  from  the  density  of  the  fluid 
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of 
gravity,  and  subduct  it  when  the  body  descends  in  a  right  line.  One 
might  also  go  on  to  the  motion  of  bodies  whi
n  a  medium  whose  distant  parts  do  not  fly  from  each  other,  are  as 
the  squares  of  the  diameters,  the  resistances  made  to  bodies  moving  with 
very  great  and  equal  velocities  in  an  elastic  fluid  will  be  as  the  squares  of 
the  diameters,  nearly. 
COR.  5.  And  since  similar,  equal,  and  equally  swift  bodies,  moving 
through  mediums  of  the  same  density,  whose  particles  do  not  fly  from  each 
other  mutually,  will  strike  against  an  equal  quantity  of  matter  in  equal 
times,  whether  the  particles  of  which  the  medium  consists  be  more  and 
smaller,  or  fewer  and  greater,  and  therefore  impress  on  that  matter  an  equal 
quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an 
equal  re-action  from  the  same,  that  is,  are  equally  resisted ;  it  is  manifest, 
also,  that  in  elastic  fluids  of  the  same  density,  when  the  bodies  move  with 
extreme  swiftness,  their  resistances  are  nearly  equal,  whether  the  fluids 
consist  of  gross  parts,  or  of  parts  ever  so  subtile.  For  the  resistance  of 
projectiles  moving  with  exceedingly  great  celerities  is  not  much  diminished 
by  the  subtilty  of  the  medium. 
COR.  G.  All  these  things  are  so  in  fluids  whose  elastic  force  takes  its  rise 
from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles.  But  if  that  force  arise  from 
some  other  cause,  as  from  the  expansion  of  the  particles  after  the  manner 
of  wool,  or  the  boughs  of  trees,  or  any  other  cause,  by  which  the  particles 
are  hindered  from  moving  freely  among  themselves,  the  resistance,  by 
reason  of  the  lesser  fluidity  of  the  medium,  will  be  greater  than  in  the 
Corollaries  above.

little  more  resistance  than  if  they  were  acu*-e  at  the  head  and  tail.  And 
bodies  moving  in  elastic  fluids,  if  they  are  obtuse  behind  and  before,  con 
dense  the  fluid  a  little  more  at  their  fore  parts,  and  relax  the  same  at  theii 
hinder  parts ;  and  therefore  meet  also  with  a  little  more  resistance  than  ii 
they  were  acute  at  the  head  and  tail.  But  in  these  Lemmas  and  Proposi 
tions  we  are  not  treating  of  elastic  but  non-elastic  fluids;  not  of  bodies 
floating  on  the  surface  of  the  fluid,  but  deeply  immersed  therein.  And 
when  the  resistance  of  bodies  in  non-elastic  fluids  is  once  known,  we  may 
then  augment  this  resistance  a  little  in  elastic  fluids,  as  our  air;  and  in 
the  surfaces  of  stagnating  fluids,  as  lakes  and  seas.

sistance  of  the  body  E  to  the  resistance  of  the  body  G.  Let  the  bodies  1) 
and  F  be  equally  swift,  as  also  the  bodies  E  and  G ;  and,  augmenting  the 
velocities  of  the^bodies  D  arid  F  in  any  ratio,  and  diminishing  the  forces 
of  the  particles  of  the  medium  B  in  the  duplicate  of  the  same  ratio,  the 
medium  B  will  approach  to  the  form  and  condition  of  the  medium  C  at 
pleasure ;  and  therefore  the  resistances  of  the  equal  and  equally  swift 
bodies  E  and  G  in  these  mediums  will  perpetually  approach  to  equality 
so  that  their  difference  will  at  last  become  less  than  any  given.  There 
fore  since  the  resistances  of  the  bodies  D  and  F  are  to  each  other  as  the 
resistances  of  the  bodies  E  and  G,  those  will  also  in  like  manner  approach 
to  the  ratio  of  equality.  Therefore  the  bodies  1)  and  F,  when  they  move 
with  very  great  swiftness,  meet  with  resistances  very  nearly  equal;  and 
therefore  since  the  resistance  of  the  body  F  is  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
velocity,  the  resistance  of  the  body  D  will  be  nearly  in  the  same  ratio. 
Con.  3.  The  resistance  of  a  body  moving  very  swift  in  an  elastic  fluid 
is  almost  the  same  as  if  the  parts  of  the  fluid  were  destitute  of  their  cen 
trifugal  forces,  and  did  not  fly  from  each  other;  if  so  be  that  the  elasti 
city  of  the  fluid  arise  from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles,  and  the 
velocity  be  so  great  as  not  to  allow  the  particles  time  enough  to  act. 
COR.  4.  Therefore,  since  the  resistances  of  similar  and  equally  swift 
bodies,  in  a  medium  whose  distant  parts  do  not  fly  from  each  other,  are  as 
the  squares  of  the  diameters,  the  resistances  made  to  bodies  moving  with 
very  great  and  equal  velocities
on  will  be  evident,  where  the  gravity  of  the 
fluid  decreases  in  any  assigned  ratio  of  the  distance  from  the  centre,  and 
also  where  the  fluid  is  more  rare  above  and  denser  below.  Q.E.D. 
COR.  1.  Therefore  the  bottom  is  not  pressed  by  the  whole  weight  of  the 
incumbent  fluid,  but  only  sustains  that  part  of  it  which  is  described  in  the 
Proposition  ;  the  rest  of  the  weight  being  sustained  archwise  by  the  spheri 
cal  figure  of  the  fluid. 
COR.  2.  The  quantity  of  the  pressure  is  the  same  always  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  centre,  whether  the  superficies  pressed  be  parallel  to  the 
horizon,  or  perpendicular,  or  oblique ;  or  whether  the  fluid,  continued  up 
wards  from  the  compressed  superficies,  rises  perpendicularly  in  a  rectilinear 
direction,  or  creeps  obliquely  through  crooked  cavities  and  canals,  whether 
those  passages  be  regular  or  irregular,  wide  or  narrow.  That  the  pressure 
is  not  altered  by  any  of  these  circumstances,  may  be  collected  by  applying 
the  demonstration  of  this  Theorem  to  the  several  cases  of  fluids. 
COR.  3.  From  the  same  demonstration  it  may  also  be  collected  (by  Prop. 
XIX),  that  the  parts  of  a  heavy  fluid  acquire  no  motion  among  themselvei 
by  the  pressure  of  the  incumbent  veight,  except  that  motion  which  arises 
from  condensation.

10  LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON. 
so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a 
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won 
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies." 
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be 
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred 
years  before  this  memorable  birth. 
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com 
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with 
small  one  which  she  possessed  at  Sewstern,  in  Leicestershire,  yield 
ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum, 
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa 
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years, 
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care 
of  her  own  mother. 
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; 
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at 
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. 
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- 
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary. 
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con 
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no 
charms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the 
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem 
ingly  dull  student  gave  him  a  severe  
60  LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON. 
years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled ;  and,  in 
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}' 
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity. 
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state 
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most 
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal 
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu 
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean 
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the 
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid, 
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably 
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was 
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge. 
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who 
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose. 
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand 
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces 
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve 
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern 
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father 
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable 
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the 
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit ;  and  the  other, 
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit, 
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con 
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he 
had  dischar

chiefly,  in  the  possession  of  the  family  of  the  Earl  of  Portsmouth, 
through  the  Viscountess  Lymington. 
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che 
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are 
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the 
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  Edinburgh. 
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke 
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in 
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: — " 'Tis  built  of  stone, 
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good 
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-, 
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger 
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University. 
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of 
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down 
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr 
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir 
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple- 
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned 
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed 
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved 
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with 
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white 
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the 
follow, ng  inscription  : — 
"  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  son  of  John  Newton,  Lord  of  the  Manor 
of  Woolsthorpe,  was  born  in  this  room,  on  the  25th  of  December,

turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed

of  discovery — the  stirring  elements  of  that  wondrous  spirit, 
which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through 
deep  onward  through  deep  of  Nature's  mysteries,  unlocking  her 
strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere  si 
lently  conquering. 
Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures, 
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn, 
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He 
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making 
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated, 
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early 
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She 
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe ;  but 
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham. 
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same 
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per 
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the 
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed, 
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune 
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar 
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated 
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and 
kindness. 
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took 
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen 
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, 
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him 
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage 
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When

It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver 
sion,  we  find,  underlying  his  whole  character  and  running  parallel 
with  all  his  discoveries,  that  extraordinary  humility  which  always 
preserved  him  in  a  position  so  relatively  just  to  the  behests  of 
time  and  eternity,  that  the  infinite  value  of  truth,  and  the  utter 
worthlessness  of  fame,  were  alike  constantly  present  to  him. 
Judging  of  his  course,  however,  in  its  more  temporary  aspect,  as 
bearing  upon  his  immediate  quiet,  it  seemed  the  most  unfortunate. 
For  an  early  publication,  especially  in  the  case  of  his  Method  of 
Fluxions,  would  have  anticipated  all  rivalry,  and  secured  him 
from  the  contentious  claims  of  Leibnitz.  Still  each  one  will  solve 
the  problem  of  his  existence  in  his  own  way,  and,  with  a  manlike 
Newton,  his  own,  as  we  conceive,  could  be  no  other  than  the  best 
way.  The  conduct  of  Leibnitz  in  this  affair  is  quite  irreconcilable 
with  the  stature  and  strength  of  the  man ;  giant-like,  and  doing 
nobly,  in  many  ways,  a  giant's  work,  yet  cringing  himself  into  the 
dimensions  and  performances  of  a  common  calumniator.  Opening 
in  1699,  the  discussion  in  question  continued  till  the  close  of 
Leibnitz's  life,  in  1716.  We  give  the  summary  of  the  case  as 
contained  in  the  Report  of  the  Committee  of  the  Royal  Society,

FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling 
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control 
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din 
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and 
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and 
moral  truth ;  ascending  height  after  height ;  sweeping  afar  over 
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en 
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly 
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose, 
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its 
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous 
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo 
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis 
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect 
God. 
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain, 
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De 
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the 
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New 
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his 
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi 
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the 
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and 
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness, 
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise 
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life
se  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common. 
I.  Absolute,  true,  and  mathematical  time,  of  itself,  and  from  its  own  na 
ture  flows  equably  without  regard  to  anything  external,  and  by  another 
name  is  called  duration  :  relative,  apparent,  and  common  time,  is  some  sen 
sible  and  external  (whether  accurate  or  unequable)  measure  of  duration  by 
the  means  of  motion,  which  is  commonly  used  instead  of  true  time ;  such 
as  an  hour,  a  day,  a  month,  a  year. 
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.  79 
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter. 
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions. 
But  because  the  parts  of  space  cannot  be  seen,  or  distinguished  from  one 
another  by  our  senses,  therefore  in  their  stead  we  use  sensible  measures  of 
them.  For  from  the  positions  and  distances  of  things  from  any  body  con 
sidered  as  immovable,  we  define  all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such 
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some 
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absol
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, 
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is 
really  at  rest,  the  body,  which  relatively  rests  in  the  ship,  will  really  and 
absolutely  move  with  the  same  velocity  which  the  ship  has  on  the  earth. 
But  if  the  earth  also  moves,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  the  body  will 
arise,  partly  from  the  true  motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space ;  partly 
from  the  relative  motion  of  the  ship  on  the  earth ;  and  if  the  body  moves 
also  relatively  in  the  ship ;  its  true  motion  will  arise,  partly  from  the  true 
motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space,  and  partly  from  the  relative  mo 
tions  as  well  of  the  ship  on  the  earth,  as  of  the  body  in  the  ship  ;  and  from 
these  relative  motions  will  arise  the  relative  motion  of  the  body  on  the 
earth.     As  if  that  part  of  the  earth,  where  the  ship  is,  was  truly  moved 
toward  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10010  parts;  while  the  ship  itself,  with 
a  fresh  gale,  and  full  sails,  is  carried  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  ex 
pressed  by  10  of  those  parts  ;  but  a  sailor  walks  in  the  ship  towards  the 
east,  with  1  part  of  the  said  velocity ;  then  the  sailor  will  be  moved  truly 
in  immovable  space  towards  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10001  parts,  and 
relatively  on  the  earth  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  of  9  of  those  parts. 
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motion
able  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. 
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the 
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no 
means  consist  in  such  relations. 
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the

absolutely  understood,  it  will  be  perpetually  mutable. 
III.  Place  is  a  part  of  space  which  a  body  takes  up,  and  is  according  to 
the  space,  either  absolute  or  relative.   I  say,  a  part  of  space ;  not  the  situation, 
nor  the  external  surface  of  the  body.     For  the  places  of  equal  solids  are 
always  equal ;  but  their  superfices,  by  reason  of  their  dissimilar  figures,  are 
often  unequal.     Positions  properly  have  no  quantity,  nor  are  they  so  much 
the  places  themselves,  as  the  properties  of  places.     The  motion  of  the  whole 
is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  the  parts ;  that  is,  the 
translation  of  the  whole,  out  of  its  place,  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum 
of  the  translations  of  the  parts  out  of  their  places ;  and  therefore  the  place 
of  the  whole  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  places  of  the  parts,  and 
for  that  reason,  it  is  internal,  and  in  the  whole  body. 
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the 
ship,  or  of  its  cavity.     But  real,  absolute  rest,  is  the  continuance  of  the 
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, 
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is 
really  at  rest,  th
all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such 
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some 
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absolute  places  and  motions, 
we  use  relative  ones;  and  that  without  any  inconvenience  in  common  af 
fairs  ;  but  in  philosophical  disquisitions,  we  ought  to  abstract  from  our 
senses,  and  consider  things  themselves,  distinct  from  what  are  only  sensible 
measures  of  them.  For  it  may  be  that  there  is  no  body  really  at  rest,  to 
which  the  places  and  motions  of  others  may  be  referred. 
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions. 
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis

strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain

the  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan 
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest. 
It  is  true,  that  the  action  of  Jupiter  upon  Saturn  is  not  to  be  neglected; 
for  the  force  of  gravity  towards  Jupiter  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  towards 
the  sun  (at  equal  distances,  Cor.  2,  Prop.  VIII)  as  1  to  1067;  and  therefore 
in  the  conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  because  the  distance  of  Saturn 
from  Jupiter  is  to  the  distance  of  Saturn  from  the  sun  almost  as  4  to  9,  the 
gravity  of  Saturn  towards  Jupiter  will  be  to  the  gravity  of  Saturn  towards 
the  sun  as  81  to  16  X  1067;  or,  as  1  to  about  21 1.  And  hence  arises  a

is  differently  situated  in  these  conjunctions,  its  eccentricity  is  sometimes 
augmented,  sometimes  diminished;  its  aphelion  is  sometimes  carried  for 
ward,  sometimes  backward,  and  its  mean  motion  is  by  turns  accelerated  and 
retarded ;  yet  the  whole  error  in  its  motion  about  the  sun,  though  arising 
from  so  great  a  force,  may  be  almost  avoided  (except  in  the  mean  motion) 
by  placing  the  lower  focus  of  its  orbit  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of 
Jupiter  and  the  sun  (according  to  Prop.  LXVII,  Book  I),  and  therefore  that 
error,  when  it  is  greatest,  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes ;  and  the  greatest 
error  in  the  mean  motion  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes  yearly.  But  in  the 
conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  the  accelerative  forces  of  gravity  of  the 
sun  towards  Saturn,  of  Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  and  of  Jupiter  towards  the 
sun,  are  almost  as  16,  81,  and  -       ~o^~~       — >  or  156609:  and  therefore 
the  difference  of  the  forces  of  gravity  of  the  sun  towards  Saturn,  and  of 
Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  towards  the 
sun  as  65  to  156609,  or  as  1  to  2409.  But  the  greatest  power  of  Saturn 
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of 
Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common 
centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth  and  moon  moves  in  an  ellipsis  about  the  sun 
in  the  focus  thereof,  and,  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun,  describes  areas  pro 
portional  to  the  times  of  description.  But  the  earth  in  the  mean  time  by

the  said  common  laws  of  attraction.  Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies 
to  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance 
from  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop.  XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it 
would  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in 
.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in 
a  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as 
that  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, 
Jupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon 
together  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing 
happens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts 
(p.  75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose.  To  hinder  such  a 
descent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required.  And  hence  depends  the 
force  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the 
planets.  Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of 
their  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de 
scend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded 
by  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the 
former  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths 
would  descend  to  the  sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, 
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor 
become  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are 
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to 
revolve  in  their  orbits,  are  
apparent  geocentric  motion,  we  infer  (by  Prop.  Ill 
Cor.  IV)  that  the  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  turned  out  of  a  rectilinear  course, 
and  made  to  revolve  in  an  orb,  is  not  directed  to  the  centre  of  the  earth. 
And  the  same  argument  holds  good  in  Mars  and  in  Saturn.  Another  centre 
of  these  forces  is  therefore  to  be  looked  for  (by  Prop.  II  and  III,  and  the 
Corollaries  of  the  latter),  about  which  the  areas  described  by  radii  inter 
vening  may  be  equable ;  and  that  this  is  the  sun,  we  have  proved  already 
in  Mars  and  Saturn  nearly,  but  accurately  enough  in  Jupiter.  It  may  be 
alledged  that  the  sun  and  planets  are  impelled  by  some  other  force  equally 
and  in  the  direction  of  parallel  lines ;  but  by  such  a  force  (by  Cor.  VI  of 
the  Laws  of  Motion)  no  change  would  happen  in  the  situation  of  the 
planets  one  to  another,  nor  any  sensible  eifect  follow  :  but  our  business  is 
with  the  causes  of  sensible  effects.  Let  us,  therefore,  neglect  every  such 
force  as  imaginary  and  precarious,  and  of  no  use  in  the  phenomena  of  the 
heavens ;  and  the  whole  remaining  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  impelled  will 
be  directed  (by  Prop.  Ill,  Cor.  I)  to  the  centre  of  the  sun. 
The  distances  of  the  planets  from  the  sun  come  out  the  same,  whether, 
with  Tycho,  we  place  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  system,  or  the  sun  with 
Copernicus  :  and  we  have  already  proved  that  these  distances  are  true  ir.

But  I  should  be  glad  the  diameters  of  the  planets  were  more  accurately 
measured  ;  and  that  may  be  done,  if  a  lamp,  set  at  a  great  distance,  is  made 
to  shine  through  a  circular  hole,  and  both  the  hole  and  the  light  of  the 
lamp  are  so  diminished  that  the  spectrum  may  appear  through  the  telescope 
just  like  the  planet,  and  may  be  defined  by  the  same  measure :  then  the 
diameter  of  the  hole  will  be  to  its  distance  from  the  objective  glass  as  the 
true  diameter  of  the  planet  to  its  distance  from  us.  The  light  of  the  lamp 
may  be  diminished  by  the  interposition  either  of  pieces  of  cloth,  or  of 
smoked  glass. 
Of  kin  to  the  analogy  we  have  been  describing,  there  is  another  observed 
between  the  forces  and  the  bodies  attracted  (p.  395,  396,  397).  Since  the 
action  of  the  centripetal  force  upon  the  planets  decreases  in  the  duplicate 
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it 
was  not  that  the  circum-solar  force  was  equally  exerted  upon  Jupiter  and 
all  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights.  And  the  same  thing 
is  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in 
  sort  from  that  distance  compounded 
with  analogous  given  quantities.  That  is,  the  law  of  attracting  force  will 
be  the  same  with  respect  to  both  distances.  Q,.E.D.

parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of 
the  particles  are  unequal,  and  their  situation  dissimilar.     But  by  the  help 
of  Prop.  LXXV  and  LXXVI,  Book  I,  and  their  Corollaries,  I  was  at  last 
satisfied  of  the  truth  of  the  Proposition,  as  it  now  lies  before  us. 
COR.  1.  Hence  we  may  find  and  compare  together  the  weights  of  bodies 
towards  different  planets  ;  for  the  weights  of  bodies  revolving  in  circles 
about  planets  are  (by  Cor.  2,  Prop.  IV,  Book  I)  as  the  diameters  of  the 
circles  directly,  and  the  squares  of  their  periodic  times  reciprocally ;  and 
their  weights  at  the  surfaces  of  the  planets,  or  at  any  other  distances  from 
their  centres,  are  (by  this  Prop.)  greater  or  less  in  the  reciprocal  duplicate 
proportion  of  the  distances.  Thus  from  the  periodic  times  of  Venus,  re

COR.  5.  The  power  of  gravity  is  of  a  different  nature  from  the  power  of 
magnetism  ;  for  the  magnetic  attraction  is  not  as  the  matter  attracted. 
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by  the  magnet ;  others  less ;  most  bodies 
not  at  all.  The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be 
increased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity 
of  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet 
decreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the 
distance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. 
PROPOSITION  VII.     THEOREM  VII. 
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to 
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. 
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law 
III)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  par

more  or  less  diminution  ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba 
ble  :  and,  in  order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of  diminution 
might  be,  he  considered  that  if  the  moon  be  retained  in  her  orbit 
by  the  force  of  gravity,  the  primary  planets  must  also  be  carried 
round  the  sun  by  the  like  power;  and,  by  comparing  the  periods 
of  the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun,  he  found 
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity, 
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in 
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the 
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now 
was  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?  Was  such  a  force,  em 
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to  the  moon,  sufficient,  when 
diminished  as  the  square  of  the  distance,  to  retain  her  in  her 
orbit  ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he  compared  the  space 
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall,  in  a  second  of  time,  at  a  given 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  namely,  at  its  surface,  with 
the  space  through  which  the  moon  falls,  as  it  were,  to  the  earth, 
in  the  same  time,  while  revolving  in  a  circular  orbit.  He  was 
absent  from  books  ;  and,  therefore,  adopted,  in  computing  the 
earth's  diameter,  the  common  estimate  of  sixty  miles  to  a  degree 
of  latitude  as  then  in  use  among  geographers  and  navigators. 
The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex 
pectations  ;  hence,  he  concluded  that  some  other  cause,  beyond  the 
reach  of  observation — analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des 
cartes — joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the 
rnooil.  Though  by  no  means  satisfied,  he  yet  aband
 by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
  another  force  different  from  that, 
then  bodies  descending  to  the  earth  with  the  joint  impulse  of  both  forces 
would  fall  with  a  double  velocity,  and  in  the  space  of  one  second  of  time 
would  describe  30^  Paris  feet ;  altogether  against  experience. 
This  calculus  is  founded  on  the  hypothesis  of  the  earth's  standing  still ; 
for  if  both  earth  and  moon  move  about  the  sun.  and  at  the  same  time  about 
their  common  centre  of  gravity,  the  distance  of  the  centres  of  the  moon  and 
earth  from  one  another  will  be  6(H  semi-diameters  of  the  earth  ;  as  may 
be  found  by  a  computation  from  Prop.  LX,  Book  I. 
SCHOLIUM. 
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by 
the  foregoing  computation.  Therefore  if  the  same  little  moon  should  be 
deserted  by  its  centrifugal  force  that  carries  it  through  its  orb,  and  so  be
upon  Jupiter  and 
all  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights.  And  the  same  thing 
is  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in  re 
spect  of  the  moon,  as  appears  from  Cor.  II  and  III,  Prop.  LXV.  Arid, 
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for 
if  the  action  was  greater  upon  some  sort  of  particles  than  upon  others  than 
in  proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter,  it  would  be  also  greater  or  less 
upon  the  whole  planets  not  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  only,  but  like 
wise  of  the  sort  of  the  matter  more  copiously  found  in  one  and  more 
sparingly  in  another. 
In  such  bodies  as  are  found  on  our  earth  of  very  different  sorts,  I  exam 
ined  this  analogy  with  great  accuracy  (p.  343,  344). 
If  the  action  of  the  circum-terrestrial  force  is  proportional  to  the  bodies 
to  be  moved,  it  will  (by  the  Second  Law  of  Motion)  move  them  with  equal 
velocity  in  equal  times,  and  will  make  all  bodies  let  fall  to  descend  through 
equal  spaces  in  equal  times,  and  all  bodies  hung  by  equal  threads  to  vibrate 
in  equal  times.  If  the  action  of  the  force  was  greater,  the  times  would  be 
less ;  if  that  was  less,  these  would  be  greater. 
But  it  has  been  long  ago  observed  by  others,  that  (allowance  being  made 
for  the  small  resistance  of  the  air)  all  bodies  descend  through  equal  spaces

time  ABK1,  the  space  of  descent  BFK ;  and  in  the  time  IKki  the  space  of 
descent  KFfk;  and  the  velocities  of  the  bodies  (proportional  to  the  re 
sistance  of  the  medium)  in  these  periods  of  time  will  be  ABED,  ABed,  O, 
ABFI,  AB/z  respectively ;  and  the  greatest  velocity  which  the  body  can 
acquire  by  descending  will  be  BACH. 
For  let  the  rectangle  BACH  be  resolved  into  in 
numerable  rectangles  AA',  K/,  Lm,  M//,  *fea,  which 
shall  be  as  the  increments  of  the  velocities  produced 
in  so  many  equal  times;  then  will  0,  AAr,  AL  Am,  An,

sition)  as  the  resistances  of  the  medium  in  the  be-    
ginning  of  each  of  the  equal  times.     Make  AC  to  AJLLB 
AK,  or  ABHC  to  AB/vK,  as  the  force  of  gravity  to  the  resistance  in  the 
beginning  of  the  second  time ;  then  from  the  force  of  gravity  subduct  the 
resistances,  and  ABHC,  K/vHC,  L/HC,  MwHC,  (fee.,  will  be  as  the  abso

is,  as  the  rectangles  AA-,  K/,  Lm,  M//,  (fee.,  and  therefore  (by  Lem.  1,  Book

area  AB^K  (by  Corol.  3,  Lem.  VII  and  VIII,  Book  I)  is  to  the  area  Bkq 
as  
 by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica

Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to

The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every

The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo

force  is  not  directed  from  P  to  T  ;  and,  secondly,  because  it  is  not  recipro 
cally  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  distance  PT.  These  things  being 
premised,  it  is  manifest  that  the  areas  are  then  most  nearly  proportional  to 
the  times,  when  that  third  force  is  the  least  possible,  the  rest  preserving 
their  former  quantity  ;  and  that  the  orbit  PAB  does  then  approach  nearest 
to  the  elliptical  figure  above-mentioned,  when  both  the  second  and  third, 
but  especially  the  third  force,  is  the  least  possible;  the  first  force  remain

Let  the  accelerative  attraction  of  the  body  T  towards  S  be  expressed  by 
the  line  SN  ;  then  if  the  accelerative  attractions  SM  and  SN  were  equal, 
these,  attracting  the  bodies  T  and  P  equally  and  in  parallel  directions 
would  not  at  all  change  their  situation  with  respect  to  each  other.  The  mo 
tions  of  the  bodies  between  themselves  would  be  the  same  in  that  case  as  if 
those  attractions  did  not  act  at  all,  by  Cor.  6,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion.  And, 
by  a  like  reasoning,  if  the  attraction  SN  is  less  than  the  attraction  SM,  it 
will  take  away  out  of  the  attraction  SM  the  part  SN,  so  that  there  will  re 
main  only  the  part  (of  the  attraction)  MN  to  disturb  the  proportionality  of 
the  areas  and  times,  and  the  elliptical  figure  of  the  orbit.  And  in  like 
manner  if  the  attraction  SN  be  greater  than  the  attraction  SM,  the  pertur 
bation  of  the  orbit  and  proportion  will  be  produced  by  the  difference  MN

His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven 
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor 
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes 
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his 
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New 
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug 
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669. 
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ; 
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis 
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science, 
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name. 
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method 
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities 
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation ;  among  the 
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria ;  among  the 
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis. 
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la- 
hours  of  his  predecessors :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved 
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented 
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this 
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination 
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their 
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing 
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as 
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor

to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines

more  or  less  diminution  ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba 
ble  :  and,  in  order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of  diminution 
might  be,  he  considered  that  if  the  moon  be  retained  in  her  orbit 
by  the  force  of  gravity,  the  primary  planets  must  also  be  carried 
round  the  sun  by  the  like  power;  and,  by  comparing  the  periods 
of  the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun,  he  found 
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity, 
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in 
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the 
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now 
was  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?  Was  such  a  force,  em 
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to  the  moon,  sufficient,  when 
diminished  as  the  square  of  the  distance,  to  retain  her  in  her 
orbit  ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he  compared  the  space 
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall,  in  a  second  of  time,  at  a  given 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  namely,  at  its  surface,  with

absent  from  books  ;  and,  therefore,  adopted,  in  computing  the 
earth's  diameter,  the  common  estimate  of  sixty  miles  to  a  degree

The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex

reach  of  observation — analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des 
cartes — joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the

77w?  quantity  of  matter  is  the  measure  of  the  same,  arising  from  its 
density  and  hulk  conjutictly. 
THUS  air  of  a  double  density,  in  a  double  space,  is  quadruple  in  quan- 
ti  ty ;  in  a  triple  space,  sextuple  in  quantity.  The  same  thing  is  to  be  un 
derstood  of  snow,  and  fine  dust  or  powders,  that  are  condensed  by  compres 
sion  or  liquefaction  •  and  of  all  bodies  that  are  by  any  causes  whatever 
differently  condensed.  I  have  no  regard  in  this  place  to  a  medium,  if  any 
such  there  is,  that  freely  pervades  the  interstices  between  the  parts  oi 
bodies.  It  is  this  quantity  that  I  mean  hereafter  everywhere  under  the 
name  of  body  or  mass.  And  the  same  is  known  by  the  weight  of  each 
body ;  for  it  is  proportional  to  the  weight,  as  I  have  found  by  experiments 
on  pendulums,  very  accurately  made,  which  shall  be  shewn  hereafter.

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the 
velocity  and  quantity  of  matter  corjunctly. 
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is 
iouble ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple, 
DEFINITION  III. 
The  vis  insita,  or  innate  force  of  matter,  is  a  power  of  resisting,  hy

present  stale,  whether  it  be  of  rest,  or  of  moving  uniformly  forward 
in  a  right  line. 
This  force  is  ever  proportional  to  the  body  whose  force  it  is ;  and  differs 
nothing  from  the  inactivity  of  the  mass,  but  in  our  manner  of  conceiving

DEFINITION  VII. 
The  accelerative  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure,  of  tht 
same,  proportional  to  the  velocity  which  it  generates  in  a  given  time. 
Thus  the  force  of  the  same  load-stone  is  greater  at  a  less  distance,  and 
less  at  a  greater :  also  the  force  of  gravity  is  greater  in  valleys,  less  on 
tops  of  exceeding  high  mountains ;  and  yet  less  (as  shall  hereafter  be  shown), 
at  greater  distances  from  the  body  of  the  earth ;  but  at  equal  distan 
ces,  it  is  the  same  everywhere ;  because  (taking  away,  or  allowing  for,  the 
resistance  of  the  air),  it  equally  accelerates  all  falling  bodies,  whether  heavy 
or  light,  great  or  small. 
DEFINITION  VIII. 
TJie  motive  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force,  is  the  measure  of  the  samt\ 
proportional  to  the  motion  which  it  generates  in  a  given  twip. 
Thus  the  weight  is  greater  in  a  greater  body,  less  in  a  less  body ;  and. 
in  the  same  body,  it  is  greater  near  to  the  earth,  and  less  at  remoter  dis 
tances.  This  sort  of  quantity  is  the  centripetency,  or  propension  of  the 
whole  body  towards  the  centre,  or,  as  I  may  say,  its  weight ;  and  it  is  al 
ways  known  by  the  quantity  of  an  equal  and  contrary  force  just  sufficient 
to  Ifinder  the  descent  of  the  body. 
These  quantities  of  forces,  we  may,  for  brevity's  sake,  call  by  the  names 
of  motive,  accelerative,  and  absolute  forces ;  and,  for  distinction's  sake,  con 
sider  them,  with  respect  to  the  bodies  that  tend  to  the  centre ;  to  the  places 
of  those  bodies ;  and  to  the  centre  of  force  towards  which  they  tend  ;  that 
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen 
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the 
sever
able  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. 
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the 
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no 
means  consist  in  such  relations. 
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
y  tend  ;  that 
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen 
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the 
several  parts  taken  together ;  the  accelerative  force  to  the  place  of  the 
body,  as  a  certain  power  or  energy  diffused  from  the  centre  to  all  places 
around  to  move  the  bodies  that  are  in  them :  and  the  absolute  force  to 
the  centre,  as  endued  with  some  cause,  without  which  those  motive  forces 
would  not  be  propagated  through  the  spaces  round  about ;  whether  that 
cause  be  some  central  body  (siuh  as  is  the  load-stone,  in  the  centre  of  the 
magnetic  force,  or  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  gravitating  force),  or 
anything  else  that  does  not  yet  appear.  For  I  here  design  only  to  give  a 
mathematical  notion  of  those  forces,  without  considering  their  physical 
causes  and  seats. 
Wherefore  the  accelerative  force  will  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  the 
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

because  the  force  with  which  the  weight  p  presses  the  plane  pQi  is  to  the 
force  with  which  the  same,  whether  by  its  own  gravity,  or  by  the  blow  of 
a  mallet,  is  impelled  in  the  direction  of  the  line  joH  towards  both  the 
planes,  as  joN  to  pH ;  and  to  the  force  with  which  it  presses  the  other 
plane  pG,  as  joN  to  NH.  And  thus  the  force  of  the  screw  may  be  deduced 
from  a  like  resolution  of  forces ;  it  being  no  other  than  a  wedge  impelled 
with  the  force  of  a  lever.  Therefore  the  use  of  this  Corollary  spreads  far 
and  wide,  and  by  that  diffusive  extent  the  truth  thereof  is  farther  con 
firmed.  For  on  what  has  been  said  depends  the  whole  doctrine  of  mechan 
ics  variously  demonstrated  by  different  authors.  For  from  hence  are  easily 
deduced  the  forces  of  machines,  which  are  compounded  of  wheels,  pullics, 
levers,  cords,  and  weights,  ascending  directly  or  obliquely,  and  other  mechan 
ical  powers ;  as  also  the  force  of  the  tendons  to  move  the  bones  of  animals. 
COROLLARY  III. 
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves. 
For  action  and  its  opposite  re-action  are  equal,  by  Law  III,  and  there 
fore,  by  Law  II,  they  produce  in  the  motions  equal  changes  towards  oppo 
site  parts.  Therefore  if  the  motions  are  directed  towards  the  same  parts. 
whatever  is  added  to  the  motion  of  the  preceding  body  will  be  subducted 
from  the  motion  of  that  which  follows  ;  so  that  the  sum  will  be  the  same 
as  before.  If  the  bodies  meet,  with  contrary  motions,  there  will  be  an 
equal  deduction

AXIOMS,  OR  LAWS  OF  MOTION. 
LAW  I. 
Hvery  body  perseveres  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  uniform  motion  in  a  ri^ht 
line,  unless  it  is  compelled  to  change  that  state  by  forces  impressed 
thereon. 
PROJECTILES  persevere  in  their  motions,  so  far  as  they  are  not  retarded 
by  the  resistance  of  the  air,  or  impelled  downwards  by  the  force  of  gravity 
A  top,  whose  parts  by  their  cohesion  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from 
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its  rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it  is  re 
tarded  by  the  air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  meeting 
with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro 
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time. 
LAW   II. 
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus 
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force 
is  impressed. 
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both. 
LAW  III. 
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction :  or  the  mu 
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di 
rected  to  contrary  parts. 
Whatever  draws  or  presses  another  is  as  much  drawn  or  pressed  by  that 
other.  If  you  press  a  stone

move  a  given  weight  with  a  given  power,  or  with  a  given  force  to  over 
come  any  other  given  resistance.  For  if  machines  are  so  contrived  that  the 
velocities  of  the  agent  and  resistant  are  reciprocally  as  their  forces,  the 
agent  will  just  sustain  the  resistant,  but  with  a  greater  disparity  of  ve 
locity  will  overcome  it.  So  that  if  the  disparity  of  velocities  is  so  great 
as  to  overcome  all  that  resistance  which  commonly  arises  either  from  the 
attrition  of  contiguous  bodies  as  they  slide  by  one  another,  or  from  the 
cohesion  of  continuous  bodies  that  are  to  be  separated,  or  from  the  weights 
of  bodies  to  be  raised,  the  excess  of  the  force  remaining,  after  all  those  re 
sistances  are  overcome,  will  produce  an  acceleration  of  motion  proportional 
thereto,  as  well  in  the  parts  of  {he  machine  as  in  the  resisting  body.  But 
to  treat  of  mechanics  is  not  my  present  business.  I  was  only  willing  to 
show  by  those  examples  the  great  extent  and  certainty  of  the  third  Law  ot 
motion.  For  if  we  estimate  the  action  of  the  agent  from  its  force  and 
velocity  conjunctly,  and  likewise  the  reaction  of  the  impediment  conjuncth 
from  the  velocities  of  its  several  parts,  and  from  the  forces  of  resistance 
arising  from  the  attrition,  cohesion,  weight,  and  acceleration  of  those  parts, 
the  action  and  reaction  'YL  the  use  of  all  sorts  of  machines  will  b"  found 
always  equal  to  one  another.  And  so  far  as  the  action  is  propagated  by 
the  intervening  instruments,  and  at  last  impressed  upon  tic  resisting 
body,  the  ultimate  determination  of  the  action  will  be  always  contrary  to 
the  determination  of  the  reaction.

expressed  by  the  equal  lineoke  DE  and  IN ;  and  let  the  force 
IN  (by  Cor.  2  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  be  resolved  into  two 
others,  NT  and  IT.  rl  hen  the  force  NT  acting  in  the  direction 
line  NT  perpendicular  to  the  path  ITK  of  the  body  will  not  at  all  affect 
or  change  the  velocity  of  the  body  in  that  path,  but  only  draw  it  aside 
from  a  rectilinear  course,  and  make  it  deflect  perpetually  from  the  tangent 
of  the  orbit,  and  proceed  in  the  curvilinear  path  ITK/j.  That  whole 
force,  therefore,  will  be  spent  in  producing  this  effect:  but  the  other  force 
IT,  acting  in  the  direction  of  the  course  of  the  body,  will  be  all  emplo
  is  gravity,  by  which  bodies  tend  to  the  centre  of  the  earth 
magnetism,  by  which  iron  tends  to  the  loadstone ;  and  that  force,  what 
ever  it  is,  by  which  the  planets  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from  the  rec 
tilinear  motions,  which  otherwise  they  would  pursue,  and  made  to  revolve 
in  curvilinear  orbits.  A  stone,  whirled  about  in  a  sling,  endeavours  to  re 
cede  from  the  hand  that  turns  it ;  and  by  that  endeavour,  distends  the 
sling,  and  that  with  so  much  the  greater  force,  as  it  is  revolved  with  the 
greater  velocity,  and  as  soon  as  ever  it  is  let  go,  flies  away.  That  force 
which  opposes  itself  to  this  endeavour,  and  by  which  the  sling  perpetually 
draws  back  the  stone  towards  the  hand,  and  retains  it  in  its  orbit,  because 
it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them 
to,  and  detains  them  in  their  orbits,  which  I  therefore  call  centripetal,  would 
tiy  off  in  right  lines,  with  an  uniform  motion.  A  projectile,  if  it  was  not 
for  the  force  of  gravity,  would  not  deviate  towards  the  earth,  tut  would
at  revolves  about 
the  centre  of  force  in  the  same  manner  as  another  body  in  the  same 
trajectory  at  rest. 
In.  the  orbit  VPK,  given  by  position,  let  the  body 
P  revolve,   proceeding  from   V  towards  K.     From 
the  centre  C  let  there  be  continually  drawn  Cp,  equal 
to  CP,  making  the  angle  VC/?  proportional  to  the 
angle  VCP ;  and  the  area  which  the  line  Cp  describes 
will  be  to  the  area  VCP,  which  the  line  CP  describes 
at  the  same  time,  ns  the  velocity  of  the  describing 
line  Cp  to  the  velocity  of  the  describing  line  CP ; 
that  is,  as  the  angle  VC/?  to  the  angle  VCP,  therefore  in  a  given  ratio, 
and  therefore  proportional  to  the  time.     Since,  then,  the  area  described  by 
the  line  Cp  in  an  immovable  plane  is  proportional  to  the  time,  it  is  manifest 
that  a  body,  being  acted  upon  by  a  just  quantity  of  centripetal  force  may
SEC.  II.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.  109 
may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies. 
The  preceding  Proposition  may  be  likewise  demonstrated  after  this 
manner.  In  any  circle  suppose  a  polygon  to  be  inscribed  of  any  number 
of  sides.  And  if  a  body,  moved  with  a  given  velocity  along  the  sides  of  the 
polygon,  is  reflected  from  the  circle  at  the  several  angular  points,  the  force, 
with  which  at  every  reflection  it  strikes  the  circle,  will  be  as  its  velocity  : 
and  therefore  the  sum  of  the  forces,  in  a  given  time,  will  be  as  that  ve 
locity  and  the  number  of  reflections  conjunctly ;  that  is  (if  the  species  of 
the  polygon  be  given),  as  the  length  described  in  that  given  time,  and  in 
creased  or  diminished  in  the  ratio  of  the  same  length  to  the  radius  of  the 
circle ;  that  is,  as  the  square  of  that  length  applied  to  the  radius ;  and 
therefore  the  polygon,  by  having  its  sides  diminished  in'inftnitum,  coin 
cides  with  the  circle,  as  the  square  of  the  arc  described  in  a  given  time  ap 
plied  to  the  radius.  This  is  the  centrifugal  force,  with  which  the  body 
impels  the  circle ;  and  to  which  the  contrary  force,  wherewith  the  circle 
continually  repels  the  body  towards  the  centre,
er  by  the  force  of  gravity,  if  it 
is  endued  with  gravity,  or  by  any  other  force,  that  impels  it  towards  the 
earth,  may  be  perpetually  drawn  aside  towards  the  earth,  out  of  the  r&ti- 
linear  way,  which  by  its  innate  force  it  would  pursue;  and  would  be  made 
to  revolve  in  the  orbit  which  it  now  describes ;  nor  could  the  moon  with 
out  some  such  force,  be  retained  in  its  orbit.  If  this  force  was  too  small, 
it  would  not  sufficiently  turn  the  moon  out  of  a  rectilinear  course :  if  it 
was  too  great,  it  would  turn  it  too  much,  arid  draw  down  the  moon  from 
its  orbit  towards  the  earth.  It  is  necessary,  that  the  force  be  of  a  just 
quantity,  and  it  belongs  to  the  mathematicians  to  find  the  force,  that  may 
serve  exactly  to  retain  a  body  in  a  given  orbit,  with  a  given  velocity ;  and 
vice  versa,  to  determine  the  curvilinear  way,  into  which  a  body  projected 
from  a  given  place,  with  a  given  velocity,  may  be  made  to  deviate  from 
its  natural  rectilinear  way,  by  means  of  a  given  force. 
The  quantity  of  any  centripetal  force  may  be  considered  as  of  three 
kinds;  aboolu'e,  accelerative,  and  motive. 
DEFINITION  VI. 
The  absolute  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure  f>f  the  same 
proportional  to  the  efficacy  of  the  cause  that  propagates  it  from  the  cen 
tre,  through  the  spaces  round  about. 
Thus  the  magnetic  force  is  greater  in  one  load-stone  and  less  in  another 
according  to  their  sizes  and  strength  of  intensity.
is  most  certain  that  these  effects  must  proceed 
from  the  action  of  some  force  or  other. 
But  our  purpose  is  only  to  trace  out  the  quantity  and  properties  of  this 
force  from  the  phenomena  (p.  218),  and  to  apply  what  we  discover  in  some 
simple  cases  as  principles,  by  which,  in  a  mathematical  way,  we  may  esti 
mate  the  effects  thereof  in  more  involved  cases :  for  it  would  be  endless  and 
impossible  to  bring  every  particular  to  direct  and  immediate  observation. 
We  said,  in  a  mathematical  way,  to  avoid  all  questions  about  the  na 
ture  or  quality  of  this  force,  which  we  would  not  be  understood  to  deter 
mine  by  any  hypothesis;  and  therefore  call  it  by  the  general  name  of  a 
centripetal  force,  as  it  is  a  force  which  is  directed  towards  some  centre ; 
and  as  it  regards  more  particularly  a  body  in  that  centre,  we  call  it  circum 
solar,  circum-terrestrial,  circum-jovial ;  and  in  like  manner  in  respect  of 
other  central  bodies. 
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in

so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a 
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won 
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies." 
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be 
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred 
years  before  this  memorable  birth. 
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com 
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with 
small  one  which  she  possessed  at  Sewstern,  in  Leicestershire,  yield 
ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum, 
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa 
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years, 
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care 
of  her  own  mother. 
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; 
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at 
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. 
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- 
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary. 
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con 
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no 
charms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the 
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem

1642."

years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled ;  and,  in 
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}' 
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity. 
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state 
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most 
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal 
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu 
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean 
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the 
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid, 
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably 
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was 
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge. 
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who 
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose. 
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand 
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces 
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve 
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern 
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father 
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable 
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the 
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit ;  and  the  other, 
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit, 
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con 
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he

chiefly,  in  the  possession  of  the  family  of  the  Earl  of  Portsmouth, 
through  the  Viscountess  Lymington. 
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che 
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are 
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the 
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  Edinburgh. 
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke 
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in 
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: — " 'Tis  built  of  stone, 
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good 
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-, 
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger 
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University. 
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of 
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down 
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr 
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir 
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple- 
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned 
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed 
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved 
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with 
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white 
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the 
follow, ng  inscription  : —

of  discovery — the  stirring  elements  of  that  wondrous  spirit, 
which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through 
deep  onward  through  deep  of  Nature's  mysteries,  unlocking  her 
strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere  si 
lently  conquering. 
Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures, 
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn, 
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He 
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making 
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated, 
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early 
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She 
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe ;  but 
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham. 
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same 
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per 
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the 
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed, 
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune 
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar 
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated 
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and 
kindness. 
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took 
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen 
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, 
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him 
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage 
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When
h 
this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi 
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have 
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines. 
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the 
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy. 
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved 
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which 
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but 
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, 
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, 
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht 
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. 
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1), 
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the 
planets. 
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de 
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an 
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces 
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for
356  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BoOK    11. 
Projectiles  excite  a  motion  in  fluids  as  they  pass  through  them,  and  this 
motion  arises  from  the  excess  of  the  pressure  of  the  fluid  at  the  fore  parts 
of  the  projectile  above  the  pressure  of  the  same  at  the  hinder  parts :  and 
cannot  be  less  in  mediums  infinitely  fluid  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  quick 
silver,  in  proportion  to  the  density  of  matter  in  each.  Now  this  excess  of 
pressure  does,  in  proportion  to  its  quantity,  not  only  excite  a  motion  in  the 
fluid,  but  also  acts  upon  the  projectile  so  as  to  retard  its  motion  ;  and  there 
fore  the  resistance  in  every  fluid  is  as  the  motion  excited  by  the  projectile 
in  the  fluid ;  and  cannot  be  less  in  the  most  subtile  aether  in  proportion  to 
the  density  of  that  aether,  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  Quicksilver,  in  pro 
portion  to  the  densities  of  those  fluids.

A  pressure  is  not  propagated  through  a  fluid  in  rectilinear  directions 
unless  ichere  the  particles  of  the  fluid  lie  in  a  right  line. 
If  the  particles  a,  b}  c,  d,  e,  lie  in  a  right  line,  the  pres 
sure  may  be  indeed  directly  propagated  from  a  to  e  ;  but 
then  the  particle  e  will  urge  the  obliquely  posited  parti

not  sustain  this  pressure,  unless  they  be  supported  by  the 
particles  h  and  k  lying  beyond  them ;  but  the  particles 
that  support  them  are  also  pressed  by  them ;  and  those  particles  cannot 
sustain  that  pressure,  without  being  supported  by,  and  pressing  upon,  those 
particles  that  lie  still  farther,  as  /  and  m,  and  so  on  in  itiflnitum.  There

And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving 
in  any  fluids  whatsoever,  though  of  the  most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris 
paribus,  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids. 
These  things  being  thus  established,  we  may  now  determine  what  part 
of  its  motion  any  globe  projected  in  any  fluid  whatsoever  would  nearly  lose 
in  a  given  time.  Let  D  be  the  diameter  of  the  globe,  and  V  its  velocity 
at  the  beginning  of  its  motion,  and  T  the  time  in  which  a  globe  with  the 
velocity  V  can  describe  in  vacua  a  space  that  is,  to  the  space  |D  as  the 
density  of  the  globe  to  the  density  of  the  fluid  ;  and  the  globe  projected

logarithm  of  the  number  — ~ —  multiplied  by  the  number  2,302585093  is 
to  the  number  7^,  by  Cor.  7,  Prop.  XXXV.  In  slow  motions  the  resist 
ance  may  be  a  little  less,  because  the  figure  of  a  globe  is  more  adapted  to 
motion  than  the  figure  of  a  cylinder  described  with  the  same  diameter.  In 
swift  motions  the  resistance  may  be  a  little  greater,  because  the  elasticity 
and  compression  of  the  fluid  do  not  increase  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
velocity.  But  these  little  niceties  I  take  no  notice  of. 
And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in

SCHOLIUM. 
The  resistance  of  spherical  bodies  in  fluids  arises  partly  from  the  tena 
city,  partly  from  the  attrition,  and  partly  from  the  density  of  the  medium. 
And  that  part  of  the  resistance  which  arises  from  the  density  of  the  fluid 
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of 
gravity,  and  subduct  it  when  the  body  descends  in  a  right  line.  One 
might  also  go  on  to  the  motion  of  bodies  whi
n  a  medium  whose  distant  parts  do  not  fly  from  each  other,  are  as 
the  squares  of  the  diameters,  the  resistances  made  to  bodies  moving  with 
very  great  and  equal  velocities  in  an  elastic  fluid  will  be  as  the  squares  of 
the  diameters,  nearly. 
COR.  5.  And  since  similar,  equal,  and  equally  swift  bodies,  moving 
through  mediums  of  the  same  density,  whose  particles  do  not  fly  from  each 
other  mutually,  will  strike  against  an  equal  quantity  of  matter  in  equal 
times,  whether  the  particles  of  which  the  medium  consists  be  more  and 
smaller,  or  fewer  and  greater,  and  therefore  impress  on  that  matter  an  equal 
quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an 
equal  re-action  from  the  same,  that  is,  are  equally  resisted ;  it  is  manifest, 
also,  that  in  elastic  fluids  of  the  same  density,  when  the  bodies  move  with 
extreme  swiftness,  their  resistances  are  nearly  equal,  whether  the  fluids 
consist  of  gross  parts,  or  of  parts  ever  so  subtile.  For  the  resistance  of 
projectiles  moving  with  exceedingly  great  celerities  is  not  much  diminished 
by  the  subtilty  of  the  medium. 
COR.  G.  All  these  things  are  so  in  fluids  whose  elastic  force  takes  its  rise 
from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles.  But  if  that  force  arise  from 
some  other  cause,  as  from  the  expansion  of  the  particles  after  the  manner 
of  wool,  or  the  boughs  of  trees,  or  any  other  cause,  by  which  the  particles 
are  hindered  from  moving  freely  among  themselves,  the  resistance,  by 
reason  of  the  lesser  fluidity  of  the  medium,  will  be  greater  than  in  the 
Corollaries  above.

little  more  resistance  than  if  they  were  acu*-e  at  the  head  and  tail.  And 
bodies  moving  in  elastic  fluids,  if  they  are  obtuse  behind  and  before,  con 
dense  the  fluid  a  little  more  at  their  fore  parts,  and  relax  the  same  at  theii 
hinder  parts ;  and  therefore  meet  also  with  a  little  more  resistance  than  ii 
they  were  acute  at  the  head  and  tail.  But  in  these  Lemmas  and  Proposi 
tions  we  are  not  treating  of  elastic  but  non-elastic  fluids;  not  of  bodies 
floating  on  the  surface  of  the  fluid,  but  deeply  immersed  therein.  And 
when  the  resistance  of  bodies  in  non-elastic  fluids  is  once  known,  we  may 
then  augment  this  resistance  a  little  in  elastic  fluids,  as  our  air;  and  in 
the  surfaces  of  stagnating  fluids,  as  lakes  and  seas.

sistance  of  the  body  E  to  the  resistance  of  the  body  G.  Let  the  bodies  1) 
and  F  be  equally  swift,  as  also  the  bodies  E  and  G ;  and,  augmenting  the 
velocities  of  the^bodies  D  arid  F  in  any  ratio,  and  diminishing  the  forces 
of  the  particles  of  the  medium  B  in  the  duplicate  of  the  same  ratio,  the 
medium  B  will  approach  to  the  form  and  condition  of  the  medium  C  at 
pleasure ;  and  therefore  the  resistances  of  the  equal  and  equally  swift 
bodies  E  and  G  in  these  mediums  will  perpetually  approach  to  equality 
so  that  their  difference  will  at  last  become  less  than  any  given.  There 
fore  since  the  resistances  of  the  bodies  D  and  F  are  to  each  other  as  the 
resistances  of  the  bodies  E  and  G,  those  will  also  in  like  manner  approach 
to  the  ratio  of  equality.  Therefore  the  bodies  1)  and  F,  when  they  move 
with  very  great  swiftness,  meet  with  resistances  very  nearly  equal;  and 
therefore  since  the  resistance  of  the  body  F  is  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
velocity,  the  resistance  of  the  body  D  will  be  nearly  in  the  same  ratio. 
Con.  3.  The  resistance  of  a  body  moving  very  swift  in  an  elastic  fluid 
is  almost  the  same  as  if  the  parts  of  the  fluid  were  destitute  of  their  cen 
trifugal  forces,  and  did  not  fly  from  each  other;  if  so  be  that  the  elasti 
city  of  the  fluid  arise  from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles,  and  the 
velocity  be  so  great  as  not  to  allow  the  particles  time  enough  to  act. 
COR.  4.  Therefore,  since  the  resistances  of  similar  and  equally  swift 
bodies,  in  a  medium  whose  distant  parts  do  not  fly  from  each  other,  are  as 
the  squares  of  the  diameters,  the  resistances  made  to  bodies  moving  with 
very  great  and  equal  velocities
on  will  be  evident,  where  the  gravity  of  the 
fluid  decreases  in  any  assigned  ratio  of  the  distance  from  the  centre,  and 
also  where  the  fluid  is  more  rare  above  and  denser  below.  Q.E.D. 
COR.  1.  Therefore  the  bottom  is  not  pressed  by  the  whole  weight  of  the 
incumbent  fluid,  but  only  sustains  that  part  of  it  which  is  described  in  the 
Proposition  ;  the  rest  of  the  weight  being  sustained  archwise  by  the  spheri 
cal  figure  of  the  fluid. 
COR.  2.  The  quantity  of  the  pressure  is  the  same  always  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  centre,  whether  the  superficies  pressed  be  parallel  to  the 
horizon,  or  perpendicular,  or  oblique ;  or  whether  the  fluid,  continued  up 
wards  from  the  compressed  superficies,  rises  perpendicularly  in  a  rectilinear 
direction,  or  creeps  obliquely  through  crooked  cavities  and  canals,  whether 
those  passages  be  regular  or  irregular,  wide  or  narrow.  That  the  pressure 
is  not  altered  by  any  of  these  circumstances,  may  be  collected  by  applying 
the  demonstration  of  this  Theorem  to  the  several  cases  of  fluids. 
COR.  3.  From  the  same  demonstration  it  may  also  be  collected  (by  Prop. 
XIX),  that  the  parts  of  a  heavy  fluid  acquire  no  motion  among  themselvei 
by  the  pressure  of  the  incumbent  veight,  except  that  motion  which  arises 
from  condensation.

Nec  fas  est  proprius  mortal?  attingere  Divos. — HALLEY. 
FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling 
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control 
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din 
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and 
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and 
moral  truth ;  ascending  height  after  height ;  sweeping  afar  over 
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en 
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly 
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose, 
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its 
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous 
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo 
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis 
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect 
God. 
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain, 
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De 
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the 
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New 
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his 
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi 
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the 
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and 
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness, 
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise 
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON,  13 
turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed
 ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth. 
RULE  IV. 
In  experimental  philosophy  we  are  to  look  upon  propositions  collected  by 
general  induction  from,  phenomena  as  accurately  or  very  nearly  true, 
notwithstanding  any  contrary  hypotheses  that  may  be  imagined,  till 
such  time  as  other  phenomena  occur,  by  which  they  may  either  be  made 
more  accurate,  or  liable  to  exceptions. 
This  rule  we  must  follow,  that  the  argument  of  induction  may  not  bf 
evaded  by  hypotheses.

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to 
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min 
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  t
ion  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  part  will  be  to  the  gravity  towards  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole.  Q.E.D. 
COR,  1.  Therefore  the  force  of  gravity  towards  any  whole  planet  arises 
from,  and  is  compounded  of,  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its  parts. 
Magnetic  and  electric  attractions  afford  us  examples  of  this ;  for  all  at 
traction  towards  the  whole  arises  from  the  attractions  towards  the  several 
parts.  The  thing  may  be  easily  understood  in  gravity,  if  we  consider  a 
greater  planet,  as  formed  of  a  number  of  lesser  planets,  meeting  together  in 
one  globe ;  for  hence  it  would  appear  that  the  force  of  the  whole  must 
arise  from  the  forces  of  the  component  parts.  If  it  is  objected,  that,  ac 
cording  to  this  law,  all  bodies  with  us  must  mutually  gravitate  one  to 
wards  another,  whereas  no  such  gravitation  any  where  appears,  I  answer, 
that  since  the  gravitation  towards  these  bodies  is  to  the  gravitation  towards 
the  whole  earth  as  these  bodies  are  to  the  whole  earth,  the  gravitation  to 
wards  them  must  be  far  less  than  to  fall  under  the  observation  of  our  senses. 
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
BOOK  Ill.J  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.  397 
By  bodies  of  the  same  density,  I  mean  those  whose  vires  inertia  are  in  the 
proportion  of  their  bulks. 
COR.  5.  The  power  of  gravity  is  of  a  different  nature  from  the  power  of 
magnetism  ;  for  the  magnetic  attraction  is  not  as  the  matter  attracted. 
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by  the  magnet ;  others  less ;  most  bodies 
not  at  all.  The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be 
increased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity 
of  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet 
decreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the 
distance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. 
PROPOSITION  VII.     THEOREM  VII. 
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to 
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. 
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law 
III)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  par

this  Book,  and  consult  such  of  the  remaining  Propositions  of  the 
first  two  Books,  as  the  references  in  this,  and  his  occasions  shall  re 
quire."  So  that  "  The  System  of  the  World"  is  composed  both 
"  in  a  popular  method,"  and  in  the  form  of  mathematical  Propo 
sitions. 
The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other 
particle  of  matter,  icith  a  force  inversely  proportional  to  the 
squares  of  their  distances — is  the  discovery  w?  ich  characterizes 
The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo 
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true. 
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
h 
this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi 
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have 
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines. 
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the 
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy. 
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved 
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which 
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but 
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, 
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, 
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht 
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. 
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1), 
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the 
planets. 
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de 
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an 
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces 
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for
396  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK  II] 
planet  are  one  to  another  as  the  matter  in  the  several  parts;  for  if  some 
parts  did  gravitate  more,  others  less,  than  for  the  quantity  of  their  matter, 
then  the  whole  planet,  according  to  the  sort  of  parts  with  which  it  most 
abounds,  would  gravitate  more  or  less  than  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of 
matter  in  the  whole.  Nor  is  it  of  any  moment  whether  these  parts  are 
external  or  internal ;  for  if,  for  example,  we  should  imagine  the  terrestrial 
bodies  with  us  to  be  raised  up  to  the  orb  of  the  moon,  to  be  there  compared 
with  its  body  :  if  the  weights  of  such  bodies  were  to  the  weights  of  the  ex 
ternal  parts  of  the  moon  as  the  quantities  of  matter  in  the  one  and  in  the 
other  respectively  •  but  to  the  weights  of  the  internal  parts  in  a  greater  or 
less  proportion,  then  likewise  the  weights  of  those  bodies  would  be  to  the 
weight  of  the  whole  moon  in  a  greater  or  less  proportion;  against  what 
we  have  shewed  above. 
COR.  1.  Hence  the  weights  of  bodies  do  not  depend  upon  their  forms 
and  textures  ;  for  if  the  weights  could  be  altered  with  the  forms,  they 
would  be  greater  or  less,  according  to  the  variety  of  forms,  in  equal  matter ; 
altogether  against  experience. 
COR.  2.  Universally,  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the 
earth ;  and  the  weights  of  all,  at  equal  distances  from  the  earth's  centre. 
are  as  the  quantities  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain.  This  is  the 
quality  of  all  bodies  within  the  reach  of  our  experiments  ;  and  therefore 
(by  Rule  III)  to  be  affirmed  of  all  bodies  whatsoever.  If  the  ather,  or  anj 
other  body,  were  either  altogether  void  of  gravity,  or  were  to  gravitate  lesr 
in  proportion  to  its  quantit

AXIOMS,  OR  LAWS  OF  MOTION. 
LAW  I. 
Hvery  body  perseveres  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  uniform  motion  in  a  ri^ht 
line,  unless  it  is  compelled  to  change  that  state  by  forces  impressed 
thereon. 
PROJECTILES  persevere  in  their  motions,  so  far  as  they  are  not  retarded 
by  the  resistance  of  the  air,  or  impelled  downwards  by  the  force  of  gravity 
A  top,  whose  parts  by  their  cohesion  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from 
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its  rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it  is  re 
tarded  by  the  air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  meeting 
with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro 
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time. 
LAW   II. 
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus 
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force 
is  impressed. 
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both. 
LAW  III. 
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction :  or  the  mu 
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di 
rected  to  contrary  parts.

proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*'

ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to 
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min 
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  t
  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves. 
From  comparing  the  forces  of  the  planets  one  with  another,  we  have 
above  seen  that  the  circum-solar  does  more  than  a  thousand  times  exceed 
all  the  rest ;  but  by  the  action  of  a  force  so  greab  it  is  unavoidable  but  that

must  descend  directly  to  the  sun,  unless  by  other  motions  they  are  impelled 
towards  other  parts :  nor  is  our  earth  to  be  excluded  from  the  number  of 
such  bodies :  for  certainly  the  moon  is  a  body  of  the  same  nature  with  the 
planets,  and  subject  to  the  same  attractions  with  the  other  planets,  seeing 
it  is  by  the  circum-terrestrial  force  that  it  is  retained  in  its  orbit.  But 
that  the  earth  and  moon  are  equally  attracted  towards  the  sun,  we  have 
above  proved ;  we  have  likewise  before  proved  that  all  bodies  are  subject  to
530 
THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. 
the  said  common  laws  of  attraction.  Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies 
to  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance 
from  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop.  XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it 
would  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in 
.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in 
a  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as 
that  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, 
Jupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon 
together  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing 
happens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts 
(p.  75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose.  To  hinder  such  a 
descent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required.  And  hence  depends  the 
force  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the 
planets.  Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of 
their  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de 
scend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded 
by  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the 
former  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths 
would  descend  to  the  sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, 
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor 
become  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are 
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to 
revolve  in  their  orbits,  are  
102  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III 
the  sun.  In  other  cases,  the  distances  of  those  centres  are  always  less :  and 
therefore,  since  that  centre  of  gravity  is  in  perpetual  rest,  the  sun,  accord 
ing  to  the  various  positions  of  the  planets,  must  perpetually  be  moved  every 
way,  but  will  never  recede  far  from  that  centre. 
Con.  Hence  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth,  the  sun,  and  all 
the  planets,  is  to  be  esteemed  the  centre  of  the  world ;  for  since  the  earth, 
the  sun,  and  all  the  planets,  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  and 
are  therefore,  according  to  their  powers  of  gravity,  in  perpetual  agitation, 
as  the  Laws  of  Motion  require,  it  is  plain  that  their  moveable  centres  can 
not  be  taken  for  the  immovable  centre  of  the  world.  If  that  body  were  to 
be  placed  in  the  centre,  towards  which  other  bodies  gravitate  most  (accord 
ing  to  common  opinion),  that  privilege  ought  to  be  allowed  to  the  sun;  but 
since  the  sun  itself  is  moved,  a  fixed  point  is  to  be  chosen  from  which  the 
centre  of  the  sun  recedes  least,  and  from  which  it  would  recede  yet 
less  if  the  body  of  the  sun  were  denser  and  greater,  and  therefore  less  apt 
to  be  moved. 
PROPOSITION  XIII.     THEOREM  XIII. 
The  planets  move  in  ellipses  tvhicli  have  their  common  focus  in  the  centre 
of  the  sini  ;  and,  by  radii  drawn,  to  tJtat  centre,  they  describe  areas  pro 
portion  al  to  the  times  of  description. 
We  have  discoursed  above  of  these  motions  from  the  Phenomena.  Now 
that  we  know  the  principles  on  which  they  depend,  from  those  principles 
we  deduce  the  motions  of  the  heavens  a  priori.  Because  the  weights  of 
the  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan 
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,

the  lower  apsis  with  an  angular  motion  of  180  deg.,  45  min.,  44  sec  ,  and 
this  angular  motion  being  repeated,  will  return  to  the  upper  apsis ;  and 
therefore  the  upper  apsis  in  each  revolution  will  go  forward  1  deg.,  31  min.,

So  much  for  the  motion  of  bodies  in  orbits  whose  planes  pass  through 
the  centre  of  force.  It  now  remains  to  determine  those  motions  in  eccen 
trical  planes.  For  those  authors  who  treat  of  the  motion  of  heavy  bodies 
used  to  consider  the  ascent  and  descent  of  such  bodies,  not  only  in  a  per 
pendicular  direction,  but  at  all  degrees  of  obliquity  upon  any  given  planes  ; 
and  for  the  same  reason  we  are  to  consider  in  this  place  the  motions  of 
bodies  tending  to  centres  by  means  of  any  forces  whatsoever,  when  those 
bodies  move  in  eccentrical  planes.  These  planes  are  supposed  to  be 
perfectly  smooth  and  polished,  so  as  not  to  retard  the  motion  of  the  bodies 
in  the  least.  Moreover,  in  these  demonstrations,  instead  of  the  planes  upon

V:  INTRODUCTION    TO 
set  up.  The  PRINCIPIA,  above  all,  glows  with  the  immortality  of 
a  transcendant  mind.  Marble  and  brass  dissolve  and  pass  away  ; 
but  the  true  creations  of  genius  endure,  in  time  and  beyond  time, 
forever  :  high  upon  the  adamant  of  the  indestructible,  they  send 
forth  afar  and  near,  over  the  troublous  waters  of  life,  a  pure,  un 
wavering,  quenchless  light  whereby  the  myriad  myriads  of  barques, 
richly  laden  with  reason,  intelligence  and  various  faculty,  are 
guided  through  the  night  and  the  storm,  by  the  beetling  shore 
and  the  hidden  rock,  the  breaker  and  the  shoal,  safely  into  havens 
calm  and  secure. 
To  the  teacher  and  the  taught,  the  scholar  and  the  student,  the 
devotee  of  Science  and  the  worshipper  of  Truth,  the  PRINCIPIA 
must  ever  continue  to  be  of  inestimable  value.  If  to  educate 
means,  not  so  much  to  store  the  memory  with  symbols  and  facts, 
as  to  bring  forth  the  faculties  of  the  soul  and  develope  them  to  the 
full  by  healthy  nurture  and  a  hardy  discipline,  then,  what  so  effec 
tive  to  the  accomplishment  of  that  end  as  the  study  of  Geometri 
cal  Synthesis  ?  The  Calculus,  in  some  shape  or  other,  is,  indeed, 
necessary  to  the  successful  prosecution  of  researches  in  the  higher 
branches  of  philosophy.  But  has  not  the  Analytical  encroached 
upon  the  Synthetical,  and  Algorithmic  Formulae  been  employed 
when  not  requisite,  either  for  the  evolution  of  truth,  or  even  its 
apter  illustration  ?  To  each  method  belongs,  undoubtedly,  an 
appropriate  use.  Newton,  himself  the  inventor  of  Fluxions, 
censured  the  handling  of  Geometrical  subjects  by  Algebraical 
calculations  ;  and  the  maturest  opinions  which  he  expressed  were 
additionally  in  favour  of  the  Geometrical  Method.  His  prefer 
ence,  so  st
 book  was  sent  to  the  Society,  and  presented  on  the 
2d  March  ;  the  third,  on  the  6th  April ;  and  the  whole  was  com 
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but 
its  algorithm  or  notation  did  not  appear  till  published  in  the 
second  volume  nf  Dr.  Wallis's  works,  in  1693. 
And  thus  was  ushered  into  existence  The  PRINCIPIA — a  work 
to  which  pre-eminence  above  all  the  productions  of  the  human 
intellect  has  been  awarded — a  work  that  must  be  esteemed  of 
priceless  worth  so  long  as  Science  has  a  votary,  or  a  single  wor 
shipper  be  left  to  kneel  at  the  altar  of  Truth.
NING  THE  FORM  OF  THE  MOST  ANCIENT 
^EAR,  closes  this  enumeration  of  his  Chronological  Writings. 
A  ihird  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  appeared  in  1726,  with  many 
changes  and  additions.  About  four  years  were  consumed  in  its 
preparation  and  publication,  which  were  under  the  superintend- 
ance  of  Dr.  Henry  Pemberton,  an  accomplished  mathematician, 
and  the  author  of  "A  VIEW  OF  SIR  ISAAC  NEWTON'S  PHILO 
SOPHY."  1728.  This  gentleman  enjoyed  numerous  opportunities 
of  conversing  with  the  aged  and  illustrious  author.  "  I  found," 
says  Pemberton,  "  he  had  read  fewer  of  the  modern  mathemati 
cians  than  one  could  have  expected;  but  his  own  prodigious 
invention  readily  supplied  him  with  what  he  might  have  an  occa 
sion  for  in  the  pursuit  of  any  subject  he  undertook.  I  have  often

and  to  teach,  and  so  render  himself,  not  the  "ornament"  cnly; 
but  inconceivably  more,  the  pre-eminent  benefactor  of  his  species. 
The  honour  of  knighthood  v/as  conferred  on  our  author  in 
1705.  Soon  afterward,  he  was  a  candidate  again  for  the  Repre 
sentation  of  the  University,  but  was  defeated  by  a  large  majority. 
It  is  thought  that  a  more  pliant  man  was  preferred  by  both  min 
isters  and  electors.  Newton  was  always  remarkable  for  simplicity 
of  dress,  and  his  only  known  departure  from  it  was  on  this  oc 
casion,  when  he  is  said  to  have  appeared  in  a  suit  of  laced 
clothes. 
The  Algebraical  Lectures  which  he  had,  Juring  nine  years, 
delivered  at  Cambridge,  were  published  by  Whiston,  in  1707, 
under  the  title  of  ARITHMETICS  UNIVERSALIS,  SINE  DE  COMPOSI 
TIONS  ET  RESOLUTIONS  ARITHMETICA  LIBER.  This  publication 
is  said  to  have  been  a  breach  of  confidence  on  Whiston's  part.  Mr. 
Ralphson,  not  long  afterward,  translated  the  work  into  English ; 
and  a  second  edition  of  it,  with  improvements  by  the  author,  was 
issued  at  London,  1712,  by  Dr.  Machin.  Subsequent  editions, 
both  in  English  and  Latin,  with  commentaries,  have  been  published. 
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro 
fessor  of  Astronomy  at  Cambridge.  The  first  edition  had  been 
sold  off  for  some  time.  Copies  of  the  work  had  become  very 
rare,  and  could  only  be  obtained  at  several  times  their  original 
cost.  A  great  number  of  letters  passed  oetween  the  author  and 
Mr.  Cotes  during  the  preparation  of  the  edition,  which  finally 
appeared  in  May,  1713.  It  had  many  alterations  and  improve 
ments,  and  was  accompanied  by  an  admirable  Preface  from  the

turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed

His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven 
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor 
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes 
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his 
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New 
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug 
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669. 
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ; 
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis 
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science, 
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name. 
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method 
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities 
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation ;  among  the 
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria ;  among  the 
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis. 
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la- 
hours  of  his  predecessors :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved 
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented 
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this 
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination 
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their 
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing 
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as 
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor 
tion  of  the  length  of  the  ordinate,  and  supposing  the  abscissa 
to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines

"  I.  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  in  London  in  the  beginning  of  the  year 
1673  ;  and  went  thence  in  or  about  March,  to  Paris,  where  he 
kept  a  correspondence  with  Mr.  Collins,  by  means  of  Mr.  Olden 
burg,  till  about  September,  1676,  and  then  returned,  by  London 
and  Amsterdam,  to  Hanover:  and  that  Mr.  Collins  was  very  free 
in  communicating  to  able  mathematicians  what  he  had  received 
from  Mr,  Newton  and  Mr.  Gregory. 
"  II.  That  when  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  the  first  time  in  London, 
he  contended  for  the  invention  of  another  differential  method, 
properly  so  called  ;  and,  notwithstanding  he  was  shown  by  Dr. 
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other 
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of 
June,  1677,  which  was  a  year  after  a  copy  of  Mr.  Newton's  letter 
of  the  10th  of  December,  1672,  had  been  sent  to  Paris  to  be 
communicated  to  him ;  and  above  four  years  after  Mr.  Collins 
began  to  communicate  that  letter  to  his  correspondents  ;  in  which 
letter  the  method  of  fluxions  was  sufficiently  described  to  any 
intelligent  person. 
"III.  That  by  Mr.  Newton's  letter,  of  the  13th  of  June,  1676 
it  appears  that  he  had  the  method  of  fluxions  above  five  years 
before  the  writing  of  that  letter.  And  by  his  Analysis  per  ^Equa- 
tiones  numero  Terminorum  Infmitas,  communicated  by  Dr.  Barrow 
to  Mr.  Collins,  in  July,  1669,  we  find  that  he  had  invented  the 
method  before  that  time.

with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro 
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time. 
LAW   II. 
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus 
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force 
is  impressed. 
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both. 
LAW  III. 
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction :  or  the  mu 
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di 
rected  to  contrary  parts.

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to 
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min 
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  t
  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves. 
From  comparing  the  forces  of  the  planets  one  with  another,  we  have 
above  seen  that  the  circum-solar  does  more  than  a  thousand  times  exceed 
all  the  rest ;  but  by  the  action  of  a  force  so  greab  it  is  unavoidable  but  that 
all  bodies  within,  nay,  and  far  beyond,  the  bounds  of  the  planetary  system 
must  descend  directly  to  the  sun,  unless  by  other  motions  they  are  impelled 
towards  other  parts :  nor  is  our  earth  to  be  excluded  from  the  number  of 
such  bodies :  for  certainly  the  moon  is  a  body  of  the  same  nature  with  the 
planets,  and  subject  to  the  same  attractions  with  the  other  planets,  seeing 
it  is  by  the  circum-terrestrial  force  that  it  is  retained  in  its  orbit.  But 
that  the  earth  and  moon  are  equally  attracted  towards  the  sun,  we  have 
above  proved ;  we  have  likewise  before  proved  that  all  bodies  are  subject  to
530 
THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. 
the  said  common  laws  of  attraction.  Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies 
to  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance 
from  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop.  XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it 
would  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in 
.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in 
a  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as 
that  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, 
Jupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon 
together  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing 
happens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts 
(p.  75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose.  To  hinder  such  a 
descent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required.  And  hence  depends  the 
force  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the 
planets.  Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of 
their  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de 
scend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded 
by  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the 
former  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths 
would  descend  to  the  sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, 
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor 
become  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are 
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to 
revolve  in  their  orbits,  are  
102  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III 
the  sun.  In  other  cases,  the  distances  of  those  centres  are  always  less :  and 
therefore,  since  that  centre  of  gravity  is  in  perpetual  rest,  the  sun,  accord 
ing  to  the  various  positions  of  the  planets,  must  perpetually  be  moved  every 
way,  but  will  never  recede  far  from  that  centre. 
Con.  Hence  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth,  the  sun,  and  all 
the  planets,  is  to  be  esteemed  the  centre  of  the  world ;  for  since  the  earth, 
the  sun,  and  all  the  planets,  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  and 
are  therefore,  according  to  their  powers  of  gravity,  in  perpetual  agitation, 
as  the  Laws  of  Motion  require,  it  is  plain  that  their  moveable  centres  can 
not  be  taken  for  the  immovable  centre  of  the  world.  If  that  body  were  to 
be  placed  in  the  centre,  towards  which  other  bodies  gravitate  most  (accord 
ing  to  common  opinion),  that  privilege  ought  to  be  allowed  to  the  sun;  but 
since  the  sun  itself  is  moved,  a  fixed  point  is  to  be  chosen  from  which  the 
centre  of  the  sun  recedes  least,  and  from  which  it  would  recede  yet 
less  if  the  body  of  the  sun  were  denser  and  greater,  and  therefore  less  apt 
to  be  moved. 
PROPOSITION  XIII.     THEOREM  XIII. 
The  planets  move  in  ellipses  tvhicli  have  their  common  focus  in  the  centre 
of  the  sini  ;  and,  by  radii  drawn,  to  tJtat  centre,  they  describe  areas  pro 
portion  al  to  the  times  of  description. 
We  have  discoursed  above  of  these  motions  from  the  Phenomena.  Now 
that  we  know  the  principles  on  which  they  depend,  from  those  principles 
we  deduce  the  motions  of  the  heavens  a  priori.  Because  the  weights  of 
the  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan 
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,

the  lower  apsis  with  an  angular  motion  of  180  deg.,  45  min.,  44  sec  ,  and 
this  angular  motion  being  repeated,  will  return  to  the  upper  apsis ;  and 
therefore  the  upper  apsis  in  each  revolution  will  go  forward  1  deg.,  31  min.,

So  much  for  the  motion  of  bodies  in  orbits  whose  planes  pass  through 
the  centre  of  force.  It  now  remains  to  determine  those  motions  in  eccen 
trical  planes.  For  those  authors  who  treat  of  the  motion  of  heavy  bodies 
used  to  consider  the  ascent  and  descent  of  such  bodies,  not  only  in  a  per 
pendicular  direction,  but  at  all  degrees  of  obliquity  upon  any  given  planes  ; 
and  for  the  same  reason  we  are  to  consider  in  this  place  the  motions  of 
bodies  tending  to  centres  by  means  of  any  forces  whatsoever,  when  those 
bodies  move  in  eccentrical  planes.  These  planes  are  supposed  to  be 
perfectly  smooth  and  polished,  so  as  not  to  retard  the  motion  of  the  bodies 
in  the  least.  Moreover,  in  these  demonstrations,  instead  of  the  planes  upon

so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a 
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won 
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies." 
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be 
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred 
years  before  this  memorable  birth. 
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com 
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with 
small  one  which  she  possessed  at  Sewstern,  in  Leicestershire,  yield 
ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum, 
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa 
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years, 
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care 
of  her  own  mother. 
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; 
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at 
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. 
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- 
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary. 
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con 
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no 
charms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the 
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem 
ingly  dull  student  gave  him  a  severe  
60  LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON. 
years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled ;  and,  in 
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}' 
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity. 
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state 
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most 
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal 
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu 
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean 
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the 
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid, 
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably 
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was 
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge. 
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who 
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose. 
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand 
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces 
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve 
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern 
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father 
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable 
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the 
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit ;  and  the  other, 
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit, 
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con 
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he 
had  dischar

chiefly,  in  the  possession  of  the  family  of  the  Earl  of  Portsmouth, 
through  the  Viscountess  Lymington. 
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che 
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are 
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the 
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  Edinburgh. 
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke 
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in 
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: — " 'Tis  built  of  stone, 
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good 
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-, 
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger 
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University. 
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of 
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down 
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr 
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir 
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple- 
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned 
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed 
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved 
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with 
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white 
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the 
follow, ng  inscription  : — 
"  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  son  of  John  Newton,  Lord  of  the  Manor 
of  Woolsthorpe,  was  born  in  this  room,  on  the  25th  of  December,

turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them

which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through

Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures, 
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn, 
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He 
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making 
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated, 
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early 
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She 
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe ;  but 
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham. 
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same 
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per 
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the 
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed, 
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune 
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar 
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated 
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and 
kindness. 
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took 
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen 
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, 
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him 
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage 
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When

It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver 
sion,  we  find,  underlying  his  whole  character  and  running  parallel 
with  all  his  discoveries,  that  extraordinary  humility  which  always 
preserved  him  in  a  position  so  relatively  just  to  the  behests  of 
time  and  eternity,  that  the  infinite  value  of  truth,  and  the  utter 
worthlessness  of  fame,  were  alike  constantly  present  to  him. 
Judging  of  his  course,  however,  in  its  more  temporary  aspect,  as 
bearing  upon  his  immediate  quiet,  it  seemed  the  most  unfortunate. 
For  an  early  publication,  especially  in  the  case  of  his  Method  of 
Fluxions,  would  have  anticipated  all  rivalry,  and  secured  him 
from  the  contentious  claims  of  Leibnitz.  Still  each  one  will  solve 
the  problem  of  his  existence  in  his  own  way,  and,  with  a  manlike 
Newton,  his  own,  as  we  conceive,  could  be  no  other  than  the  best 
way.  The  conduct  of  Leibnitz  in  this  affair  is  quite  irreconcilable 
with  the  stature  and  strength  of  the  man ;  giant-like,  and  doing 
nobly,  in  many  ways,  a  giant's  work,  yet  cringing  himself  into  the 
dimensions  and  performances  of  a  common  calumniator.  Opening 
in  1699,  the  discussion  in  question  continued  till  the  close  of 
Leibnitz's  life,  in  1716.  We  give  the  summary  of  the  case  as 
contained  in  the  Report  of  the  Committee  of  the  Royal  Society,

Nec  fas  est  proprius  mortal?  attingere  Divos. — HALLEY. 
FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling 
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control 
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din 
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and 
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and 
moral  truth ;  ascending  height  after  height ;  sweeping  afar  over 
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en 
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly 
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose, 
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its 
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous 
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo 
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis 
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect 
God. 
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain, 
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De 
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the 
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New 
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his 
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi 
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the 
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and 
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness, 
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise 
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life

set  up.  The  PRINCIPIA,  above  all,  glows  with  the  immortality  of 
a  transcendant  mind.  Marble  and  brass  dissolve  and  pass  away  ; 
but  the  true  creations  of  genius  endure,  in  time  and  beyond  time, 
forever  :  high  upon  the  adamant  of  the  indestructible,  they  send 
forth  afar  and  near,  over  the  troublous  waters  of  life,  a  pure,  un 
wavering,  quenchless  light  whereby  the  myriad  myriads  of  barques, 
richly  laden  with  reason,  intelligence  and  various  faculty,  are 
guided  through  the  night  and  the  storm,  by  the  beetling  shore 
and  the  hidden  rock,  the  breaker  and  the  shoal,  safely  into  havens 
calm  and  secure. 
To  the  teacher  and  the  taught,  the  scholar  and  the  student,  the 
devotee  of  Science  and  the  worshipper  of  Truth,  the  PRINCIPIA 
must  ever  continue  to  be  of  inestimable  value.  If  to  educate 
means,  not  so  much  to  store  the  memory  with  symbols  and  facts, 
as  to  bring  forth  the  faculties  of  the  soul  and  develope  them  to  the 
full  by  healthy  nurture  and  a  hardy  discipline,  then,  what  so  effec 
tive  to  the  accomplishment  of  that  end  as  the  study  of  Geometri 
cal  Synthesis  ?  The  Calculus,  in  some  shape  or  other,  is,  indeed, 
necessary  to  the  successful  prosecution  of  researches  in  the  higher 
branches  of  philosophy.  But  has  not  the  Analytical  encroached 
upon  the  Synthetical,  and  Algorithmic  Formulae  been  employed 
when  not  requisite,  either  for  the  evolution  of  truth,  or  even  its 
apter  illustration  ?  To  each  method  belongs,  undoubtedly,  an 
appropriate  use.  Newton,  himself  the  inventor  of  Fluxions, 
censured  the  handling  of  Geometrical  subjects  by  Algebraical 
calculations  ;  and  the  maturest  opinions  which  he  expressed  were 
additionally  in  favour  of  the  Geometrical  Method.  His  prefer 
ence,  so  st
 book  was  sent  to  the  Society,  and  presented  on  the 
2d  March  ;  the  third,  on  the  6th  April ;  and  the  whole  was  com 
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but 
its  algorithm  or  notation  did  not  appear  till  published  in  the 
second  volume  nf  Dr.  Wallis's  works,  in  1693. 
And  thus  was  ushered  into  existence  The  PRINCIPIA — a  work 
to  which  pre-eminence  above  all  the  productions  of  the  human 
intellect  has  been  awarded — a  work  that  must  be  esteemed  of 
priceless  worth  so  long  as  Science  has  a  votary,  or  a  single  wor 
shipper  be  left  to  kneel  at  the  altar  of  Truth.
NING  THE  FORM  OF  THE  MOST  ANCIENT 
^EAR,  closes  this  enumeration  of  his  Chronological  Writings. 
A  ihird  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  appeared  in  1726,  with  many 
changes  and  additions.  About  four  years  were  consumed  in  its 
preparation  and  publication,  which  were  under  the  superintend- 
ance  of  Dr.  Henry  Pemberton,  an  accomplished  mathematician, 
and  the  author  of  "A  VIEW  OF  SIR  ISAAC  NEWTON'S  PHILO 
SOPHY."  1728.  This  gentleman  enjoyed  numerous  opportunities 
of  conversing  with  the  aged  and  illustrious  author.  "  I  found," 
says  Pemberton,  "  he  had  read  fewer  of  the  modern  mathemati 
cians  than  one  could  have  expected;  but  his  own  prodigious 
invention  readily  supplied  him  with  what  he  might  have  an  occa 
sion  for  in  the  pursuit  of  any  subject  he  undertook.  I  have  often

and  to  teach,  and  so  render  himself,  not  the  "ornament"  cnly; 
but  inconceivably  more,  the  pre-eminent  benefactor  of  his  species. 
The  honour  of  knighthood  v/as  conferred  on  our  author  in 
1705.  Soon  afterward,  he  was  a  candidate  again  for  the  Repre 
sentation  of  the  University,  but  was  defeated  by  a  large  majority. 
It  is  thought  that  a  more  pliant  man  was  preferred  by  both  min 
isters  and  electors.  Newton  was  always  remarkable  for  simplicity 
of  dress,  and  his  only  known  departure  from  it  was  on  this  oc 
casion,  when  he  is  said  to  have  appeared  in  a  suit  of  laced 
clothes. 
The  Algebraical  Lectures  which  he  had,  Juring  nine  years, 
delivered  at  Cambridge,  were  published  by  Whiston,  in  1707, 
under  the  title  of  ARITHMETICS  UNIVERSALIS,  SINE  DE  COMPOSI 
TIONS  ET  RESOLUTIONS  ARITHMETICA  LIBER.  This  publication 
is  said  to  have  been  a  breach  of  confidence  on  Whiston's  part.  Mr. 
Ralphson,  not  long  afterward,  translated  the  work  into  English ; 
and  a  second  edition  of  it,  with  improvements  by  the  author,  was 
issued  at  London,  1712,  by  Dr.  Machin.  Subsequent  editions, 
both  in  English  and  Latin,  with  commentaries,  have  been  published. 
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro 
fessor  of  Astronomy  at  Cambridge.  The  first  edition  had  been 
sold  off  for  some  time.  Copies  of  the  work  had  become  very 
rare,  and  could  only  be  obtained  at  several  times  their  original 
cost.  A  great  number  of  letters  passed  oetween  the  author  and 
Mr.  Cotes  during  the  preparation  of  the  edition,  which  finally 
appeared  in  May,  1713.  It  had  many  alterations  and  improve 
ments,  and  was  accompanied  by  an  admirable  Preface  from  the

turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed

His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven 
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor 
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes 
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his 
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New 
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug 
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669. 
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ; 
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis 
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science, 
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name. 
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method 
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities 
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation ;  among  the 
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria ;  among  the 
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis. 
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la- 
hours  of  his  predecessors :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved 
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented 
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this 
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination 
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their 
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing 
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as 
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor 
tion  of  the  length  of  the  ordinate,  and  supposing  the  abscissa 
to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines 
as  generated  b
 ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth. 
RULE  IV. 
In  experimental  philosophy  we  are  to  look  upon  propositions  collected  by 
general  induction  from,  phenomena  as  accurately  or  very  nearly  true, 
notwithstanding  any  contrary  hypotheses  that  may  be  imagined,  till 
such  time  as  other  phenomena  occur,  by  which  they  may  either  be  made 
more  accurate,  or  liable  to  exceptions. 
This  rule  we  must  follow,  that  the  argument  of  induction  may  not  bf 
evaded  by  hypotheses.

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to 
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min 
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  t
ion  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  part  will  be  to  the  gravity  towards  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole.  Q.E.D. 
COR,  1.  Therefore  the  force  of  gravity  towards  any  whole  planet  arises 
from,  and  is  compounded  of,  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its  parts. 
Magnetic  and  electric  attractions  afford  us  examples  of  this ;  for  all  at 
traction  towards  the  whole  arises  from  the  attractions  towards  the  several 
parts.  The  thing  may  be  easily  understood  in  gravity,  if  we  consider  a 
greater  planet,  as  formed  of  a  number  of  lesser  planets,  meeting  together  in 
one  globe ;  for  hence  it  would  appear  that  the  force  of  the  whole  must 
arise  from  the  forces  of  the  component  parts.  If  it  is  objected,  that,  ac 
cording  to  this  law,  all  bodies  with  us  must  mutually  gravitate  one  to 
wards  another,  whereas  no  such  gravitation  any  where  appears,  I  answer, 
that  since  the  gravitation  towards  these  bodies  is  to  the  gravitation  towards 
the  whole  earth  as  these  bodies  are  to  the  whole  earth,  the  gravitation  to 
wards  them  must  be  far  less  than  to  fall  under  the  observation  of  our  senses. 
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
BOOK  Ill.J  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.  397 
By  bodies  of  the  same  density,  I  mean  those  whose  vires  inertia  are  in  the 
proportion  of  their  bulks. 
COR.  5.  The  power  of  gravity  is  of  a  different  nature  from  the  power  of 
magnetism  ;  for  the  magnetic  attraction  is  not  as  the  matter  attracted. 
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by  the  magnet ;  others  less ;  most  bodies 
not  at  all.  The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be 
increased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity 
of  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet 
decreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the 
distance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. 
PROPOSITION  VII.     THEOREM  VII. 
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to 
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. 
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law 
III)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B

The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other 
particle  of  matter,  icith  a  force  inversely  proportional  to  the 
squares  of  their  distances — is  the  discovery  w?  ich  characterizes 
The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo 
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true. 
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of

this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi 
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have 
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines. 
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the 
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy. 
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved 
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which 
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but 
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, 
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, 
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht 
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. 
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1), 
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the 
planets. 
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de 
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an 
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces 
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for

"  I.  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  in  London  in  the  beginning  of  the  year 
1673  ;  and  went  thence  in  or  about  March,  to  Paris,  where  he 
kept  a  correspondence  with  Mr.  Collins,  by  means  of  Mr.  Olden 
burg,  till  about  September,  1676,  and  then  returned,  by  London 
and  Amsterdam,  to  Hanover:  and  that  Mr.  Collins  was  very  free 
in  communicating  to  able  mathematicians  what  he  had  received 
from  Mr,  Newton  and  Mr.  Gregory. 
"  II.  That  when  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  the  first  time  in  London, 
he  contended  for  the  invention  of  another  differential  method, 
properly  so  called  ;  and,  notwithstanding  he  was  shown  by  Dr. 
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other 
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of 
June,  1677,  which  was  a  year  after  a  copy  of  Mr.  Newton's  letter 
of  the  10th  of  December,  1672,  had  been  sent  to  Paris  to  be 
communicated  to  him ;  and  above  four  years  after  Mr.  Collins 
began  to  communicate  that  letter  to  his  correspondents  ;  in  which 
letter  the  method  of  fluxions  was  sufficiently  described  to  any 
intelligent  person. 
"III.  That  by  Mr.  Newton's  letter,  of  the  13th  of  June,  1676 
it  appears  that  he  had  the  method  of  fluxions  above  five  years 
before  the  writing  of  that  letter.  And  by  his  Analysis  per  ^Equa- 
tiones  numero  Terminorum  Infmitas,  communicated  by  Dr.  Barrow 
to  Mr.  Collins,  in  July,  1669,  we  find  that  he  had  invented  the 
method  before  that  time.

planet  are  one  to  another  as  the  matter  in  the  several  parts;  for  if  some 
parts  did  gravitate  more,  others  less,  than  for  the  quantity  of  their  matter, 
then  the  whole  planet,  according  to  the  sort  of  parts  with  which  it  most 
abounds,  would  gravitate  more  or  less  than  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of 
matter  in  the  whole.  Nor  is  it  of  any  moment  whether  these  parts  are 
external  or  internal ;  for  if,  for  example,  we  should  imagine  the  terrestrial 
bodies  with  us  to  be  raised  up  to  the  orb  of  the  moon,  to  be  there  compared 
with  its  body  :  if  the  weights  of  such  bodies  were  to  the  weights  of  the  ex 
ternal  parts  of  the  moon  as  the  quantities  of  matter  in  the  one  and  in  the 
other  respectively  •  but  to  the  weights  of  the  internal  parts  in  a  greater  or 
less  proportion,  then  likewise  the  weights  of  those  bodies  would  be  to  the 
weight  of  the  whole  moon  in  a  greater  or  less  proportion;  against  what 
we  have  shewed  above. 
COR.  1.  Hence  the  weights  of  bodies  do  not  depend  upon  their  forms 
and  textures  ;  for  if  the  weights  could  be  altered  with  the  forms,  they 
would  be  greater  or  less,  according  to  the  variety  of  forms,  in  equal  matter ; 
altogether  against  experience. 
COR.  2.  Universally,  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the 
earth ;  and  the  weights  of  all,  at  equal  distances  from  the  earth's  centre. 
are  as  the  quantities  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain.  This  is  the 
quality  of  all  bodies  within  the  reach  of  our  experiments  ;  and  therefore 
(by  Rule  III)  to  be  affirmed  of  all  bodies  whatsoever.  If  the  ather,  or  anj

77w?  quantity  of  matter  is  the  measure  of  the  same,  arising  from  its 
density  and  hulk  conjutictly. 
THUS  air  of  a  double  density,  in  a  double  space,  is  quadruple  in  quan- 
ti  ty ;  in  a  triple  space,  sextuple  in  quantity.  The  same  thing  is  to  be  un 
derstood  of  snow,  and  fine  dust  or  powders,  that  are  condensed  by  compres 
sion  or  liquefaction  •  and  of  all  bodies  that  are  by  any  causes  whatever 
differently  condensed.  I  have  no  regard  in  this  place  to  a  medium,  if  any 
such  there  is,  that  freely  pervades  the  interstices  between  the  parts  oi 
bodies.  It  is  this  quantity  that  I  mean  hereafter  everywhere  under  the 
name  of  body  or  mass.  And  the  same  is  known  by  the  weight  of  each 
body ;  for  it  is  proportional  to  the  weight,  as  I  have  found  by  experiments 
on  pendulums,  very  accurately  made,  which  shall  be  shewn  hereafter. 
DEFINITION  II. 
The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the 
velocity  and  quantity  of  matter  corjunctly. 
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is 
iouble ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple,

The  vis  insita,  or  innate  force  of  matter,  is  a  power  of  resisting,  hy 
which  every  body,  as  much  as  in  it  lies,  endeavours  to  persevere  in  its 
present  stale,  whether  it  be  of  rest,  or  of  moving  uniformly  forward 
in  a  right  line. 
This  force  is  ever  proportional  to  the  body  whose  force  it  is ;  and  differs 
nothing  from  the  inactivity  of  the  mass,  but  in  our  manner  of  conceiving
76  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES 
DEFINITION  VII. 
The  accelerative  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure,  of  tht 
same,  proportional  to  the  velocity  which  it  generates  in  a  given  time. 
Thus  the  force  of  the  same  load-stone  is  greater  at  a  less  distance,  and 
less  at  a  greater :  also  the  force  of  gravity  is  greater  in  valleys,  less  on 
tops  of  exceeding  high  mountains ;  and  yet  less  (as  shall  hereafter  be  shown), 
at  greater  distances  from  the  body  of  the  earth ;  but  at  equal  distan 
ces,  it  is  the  same  everywhere ;  because  (taking  away,  or  allowing  for,  the 
resistance  of  the  air),  it  equally  accelerates  all  falling  bodies,  whether  heavy 
or  light,  great  or  small. 
DEFINITION  VIII. 
TJie  motive  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force,  is  the  measure  of  the  samt\ 
proportional  to  the  motion  which  it  generates  in  a  given  twip. 
Thus  the  weight  is  greater  in  a  greater  body,  less  in  a  less  body ;  and. 
in  the  same  body,  it  is  greater  near  to  the  earth,  and  less  at  remoter  dis 
tances.  This  sort  of  quantity  is  the  centripetency,  or  propension  of  the 
whole  body  towards  the  centre,  or,  as  I  may  say,  its  weight ;  and  it  is  al 
ways  known  by  the  quantity  of  an  equal  and  contrary  force  just  sufficient 
to  Ifinder  the  descent  of  the  body. 
These  quantities  of  forces,  we  may,  for  brevity's  sake,  call  by  the  names 
of  motive,  accelerative,  and  absolute  forces ;  and,  for  distinction's  sake,  con 
sider  them,  with  respect  to  the  bodies  that  tend  to  the  centre ;  to  the  places 
of  those  bodies ;  and  to  the  centre  of  force  towards  which  they  tend  ;  that 
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen 
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the 
sever
able  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. 
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the 
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no 
means  consist  in  such  relations. 
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
y  tend  ;  that 
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen 
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the 
several  parts  taken  together ;  the  accelerative  force  to  the  place  of  the 
body,  as  a  certain  power  or  energy  diffused  from  the  centre  to  all  places 
around  to  move  the  bodies  that  are  in  them :  and  the  absolute  force  to 
the  centre,  as  endued  with  some  cause,  without  which  those  motive  forces 
would  not  be  propagated  through  the  spaces  round  about ;  whether  that 
cause  be  some  central  body  (siuh  as  is  the  load-stone,  in  the  centre  of  the 
magnetic  force,  or  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  gravitating  force),  or 
anything  else  that  does  not  yet  appear.  For  I  here  design  only  to  give  a 
mathematical  notion  of  those  forces,  without  considering  their  physical 
causes  and  seats. 
Wherefore  the  accelerative  force  will  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  the 
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the
8G  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES 
because  the  force  with  which  the  weight  p  presses  the  plane  pQi  is  to  the 
force  with  which  the  same,  whether  by  its  own  gravity,  or  by  the  blow  of 
a  mallet,  is  impelled  in  the  direction  of  the  line  joH  towards  both  the 
planes,  as  joN  to  pH ;  and  to  the  force  with  which  it  presses  the  other 
plane  pG,  as  joN  to  NH.  And  thus  the  force  of  the  screw  may  be  deduced 
from  a  like  resolution  of  forces ;  it  being  no  other  than  a  wedge  impelled 
with  the  force  of  a  lever.  Therefore  the  use  of  this  Corollary  spreads  far 
and  wide,  and  by  that  diffusive  extent  the  truth  thereof  is  farther  con 
firmed.  For  on  what  has  been  said  depends  the  whole  doctrine  of  mechan 
ics  variously  demonstrated  by  different  authors.  For  from  hence  are  easily 
deduced  the  forces  of  machines,  which  are  compounded  of  wheels,  pullics, 
levers,  cords,  and  weights,  ascending  directly  or  obliquely,  and  other  mechan 
ical  powers ;  as  also  the  force  of  the  tendons  to  move  the  bones  of  animals. 
COROLLARY  III. 
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves. 
For  action  and  its  opposite  re-action  are  equal,  by  Law  III,  and  there 
fore,  by  Law  II,  they  produce  in  the  motions  equal  changes  towards  oppo 
site  parts.  Therefore  if  the  motions  are  directed  towards  the  same  parts. 
whatever  is  added  to  the  motion  of  the  preceding  body  will  be  subducted 
from  the  motion  of  that  which  follows  ;  so  that  the  sum  will  be  the  same 
as  before.  If  the  bodies  meet,  with  contrary  motions,  there  will  be  an 
equal  deduction
OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 
AXIOMS,  OR  LAWS  OF  MOTION. 
LAW  I. 
Hvery  body  perseveres  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  uniform  motion  in  a  ri^ht 
line,  unless  it  is  compelled  to  change  that  state  by  forces  impressed 
thereon. 
PROJECTILES  persevere  in  their  motions,  so  far  as  they  are  not  retarded 
by  the  resistance  of  the  air,  or  impelled  downwards  by  the  force  of  gravity 
A  top,  whose  parts  by  their  cohesion  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from 
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its  rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it  is  re 
tarded  by  the  air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  meeting 
with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro 
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time. 
LAW   II. 
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus 
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force 
is  impressed. 
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both. 
LAW  III. 
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction :  or  the  mu 
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di 
rected  to  contrary  parts. 
Whatever  draws  or  presses  another  is  as  much  drawn  or  pressed  by  that 
other.  If  you  press  a  stone 
roblem ;  7 
move  a  given  weight  with  a  given  power,  or  with  a  given  force  to  over 
come  any  other  given  resistance.  For  if  machines  are  so  contrived  that  the 
velocities  of  the  agent  and  resistant  are  reciprocally  as  their  forces,  the 
agent  will  just  sustain  the  resistant,  but  with  a  greater  disparity  of  ve 
locity  will  overcome  it.  So  that  if  the  disparity  of  velocities  is  so  great 
as  to  overcome  all  that  resistance  which  commonly  arises  either  from  the 
attrition  of  contiguous  bodies  as  they  slide  by  one  another,  or  from  the 
cohesion  of  continuous  bodies  that  are  to  be  separated,  or  from  the  weights 
of  bodies  to  be  raised,  the  excess  of  the  force  remaining,  after  all  those  re 
sistances  are  overcome,  will  produce  an  acceleration  of  motion  proportional 
thereto,  as  well  in  the  parts  of  {he  machine  as  in  the  resisting  body.  But 
to  treat  of  mechanics  is  not  my  present  business.  I  was  only  willing  to 
show  by  those  examples  the  great  extent  and  certainty  of  the  third  Law  ot 
motion.  For  if  we  estimate  the  action  of  the  agent  from  its  force  and 
velocity  conjunctly,  and  likewise  the  reaction  of  the  impediment  conjuncth 
from  the  velocities  of  its  several  parts,  and  from  the  forces  of  resistance 
arising  from  the  attrition,  cohesion,  weight,  and  acceleration  of  those  parts, 
the  action  and  reaction  'YL  the  use  of  all  sorts  of  machines  will  b"  found 
always  equal  to  one  another.  And  so  far  as  the  action  is  propagated  by 
the  intervening  instruments,  and  at  last  impressed  upon  tic  resisting 
body,  the  ultimate  determination  of  the  action  will  be  always  contrary  to 
the  determination  of  the  reaction.

cede  from  the  hand  that  turns  it ;  and  by  that  endeavour,  distends  the 
sling,  and  that  with  so  much  the  greater  force,  as  it  is  revolved  with  the 
greater  velocity,  and  as  soon  as  ever  it  is  let  go,  flies  away.  That  force 
which  opposes  itself  to  this  endeavour,  and  by  which  the  sling  perpetually 
draws  back  the  stone  towards  the  hand,  and  retains  it  in  its  orbit,  because 
it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them 
to,  and  detains  them  in  their  orbits,  which  I  therefore  call  centripetal,  would 
tiy  off  in  right  lines,  with  an  uniform  motion.  A  projectile,  if  it  was  not 
for  the  force  of  gravity,  would  not  deviate  towards  the  earth,  tut  would
at  revolves  about 
the  centre  of  force  in  the  same  manner  as  another  body  in  the  same 
trajectory  at  rest. 
In.  the  orbit  VPK,  given  by  position,  let  the  body 
P  revolve,   proceeding  from   V  towards  K.     From 
the  centre  C  let  there  be  continually  drawn  Cp,  equal 
to  CP,  making  the  angle  VC/?  proportional  to  the 
angle  VCP ;  and  the  area  which  the  line  Cp  describes 
will  be  to  the  area  VCP,  which  the  line  CP  describes 
at  the  same  time,  ns  the  velocity  of  the  describing 
line  Cp  to  the  velocity  of  the  describing  line  CP ; 
that  is,  as  the  angle  VC/?  to  the  angle  VCP,  therefore  in  a  given  ratio, 
and  therefore  proportional  to  the  time.     Since,  then,  the  area  described  by 
the  line  Cp  in  an  immovable  plane  is  proportional  to  the  time,  it  is  manifest 
that  a  body,  being  acted  upon  by  a  just  quantity  of  centripetal  force  may

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies. 
The  preceding  Proposition  may  be  likewise  demonstrated  after  this 
manner.  In  any  circle  suppose  a  polygon  to  be  inscribed  of  any  number 
of  sides.  And  if  a  body,  moved  with  a  given  velocity  along  the  sides  of  the 
polygon,  is  reflected  from  the  circle  at  the  several  angular  points,  the  force, 
with  which  at  every  reflection  it  strikes  the  circle,  will  be  as  its  velocity  : 
and  therefore  the  sum  of  the  forces,  in  a  given  time,  will  be  as  that  ve 
locity  and  the  number  of  reflections  conjunctly ;  that  is  (if  the  species  of 
the  polygon  be  given),  as  the  length  described  in  that  given  time,  and  in 
creased  or  diminished  in  the  ratio  of  the  same  length  to  the  radius  of  the 
circle ;  that  is,  as  the  square  of  that  length  applied  to  the  radius ;  and 
therefore  the  polygon,  by  having  its  sides  diminished  in'inftnitum,  coin 
cides  with  the  circle,  as  the  square  of  the  arc  described  in  a  given  time  ap 
plied  to  the  radius.  This  is  the  centrifugal  force,  with  which  the  body 
impels  the  circle ;  and  to  which  the  contrary  force,  wherewith  the  circle 
continually  repels  the  body  towards  the  centre,
er  by  the  force  of  gravity,  if  it 
is  endued  with  gravity,  or  by  any  other  force,  that  impels  it  towards  the 
earth,  may  be  perpetually  drawn  aside  towards  the  earth,  out  of  the  r&ti- 
linear  way,  which  by  its  innate  force  it  would  pursue;  and  would  be  made 
to  revolve  in  the  orbit  which  it  now  describes ;  nor  could  the  moon  with 
out  some  such  force,  be  retained  in  its  orbit.  If  this  force  was  too  small, 
it  would  not  sufficiently  turn  the  moon  out  of  a  rectilinear  course :  if  it 
was  too  great,  it  would  turn  it  too  much,  arid  draw  down  the  moon  from 
its  orbit  towards  the  earth.  It  is  necessary,  that  the  force  be  of  a  just 
quantity,  and  it  belongs  to  the  mathematicians  to  find  the  force,  that  may 
serve  exactly  to  retain  a  body  in  a  given  orbit,  with  a  given  velocity ;  and 
vice  versa,  to  determine  the  curvilinear  way,  into  which  a  body  projected 
from  a  given  place,  with  a  given  velocity,  may  be  made  to  deviate  from 
its  natural  rectilinear  way,  by  means  of  a  given  force. 
The  quantity  of  any  centripetal  force  may  be  considered  as  of  three 
kinds;  aboolu'e,  accelerative,  and  motive. 
DEFINITION  VI. 
The  absolute  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure  f>f  the  same 
proportional  to  the  efficacy  of  the  cause  that  propagates  it  from  the  cen 
tre,  through  the  spaces  round  about. 
Thus  the  magnetic  force  is  greater  in  one  load-stone  and  less  in  another 
according  to  their  sizes  and  strength  of  intensity.
is  most  certain  that  these  effects  must  proceed 
from  the  action  of  some  force  or  other. 
But  our  purpose  is  only  to  trace  out  the  quantity  and  properties  of  this 
force  from  the  phenomena  (p.  218),  and  to  apply  what  we  discover  in  some 
simple  cases  as  principles,  by  which,  in  a  mathematical  way,  we  may  esti 
mate  the  effects  thereof  in  more  involved  cases :  for  it  would  be  endless  and 
impossible  to  bring  every  particular  to  direct  and  immediate  observation. 
We  said,  in  a  mathematical  way,  to  avoid  all  questions  about  the  na 
ture  or  quality  of  this  force,  which  we  would  not  be  understood  to  deter 
mine  by  any  hypothesis;  and  therefore  call  it  by  the  general  name  of  a 
centripetal  force,  as  it  is  a  force  which  is  directed  towards  some  centre ; 
and  as  it  regards  more  particularly  a  body  in  that  centre,  we  call  it  circum 
solar,  circum-terrestrial,  circum-jovial ;  and  in  like  manner  in  respect  of 
other  central  bodies. 
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
h 
this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi 
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have 
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines. 
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the 
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy. 
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved 
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which 
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but 
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, 
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, 
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht 
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. 
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1), 
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the 
planets. 
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de 
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an 
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces 
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for

time  ABK1,  the  space  of  descent  BFK ;  and  in  the  time  IKki  the  space  of 
descent  KFfk;  and  the  velocities  of  the  bodies  (proportional  to  the  re 
sistance  of  the  medium)  in  these  periods  of  time  will  be  ABED,  ABed,  O, 
ABFI,  AB/z  respectively ;  and  the  greatest  velocity  which  the  body  can 
acquire  by  descending  will  be  BACH. 
For  let  the  rectangle  BACH  be  resolved  into  in 
numerable  rectangles  AA',  K/,  Lm,  M//,  *fea,  which 
shall  be  as  the  increments  of  the  velocities  produced 
in  so  many  equal  times;  then  will  0,  AAr,  AL  Am,  An,

sition)  as  the  resistances  of  the  medium  in  the  be-    
ginning  of  each  of  the  equal  times.     Make  AC  to  AJLLB 
AK,  or  ABHC  to  AB/vK,  as  the  force  of  gravity  to  the  resistance  in  the 
beginning  of  the  second  time ;  then  from  the  force  of  gravity  subduct  the 
resistances,  and  ABHC,  K/vHC,  L/HC,  MwHC,  (fee.,  will  be  as  the  abso 
lute  forces  with  which  the  body  is  acted  upon  in  the  beginning  of  each  of

is,  as  the  rectangles  AA-,  K/,  Lm,  M//,  (fee.,  and  therefore  (by  Lem.  1,  Book

fore  analogous  to  the  equal  times  and  equal  gravitating  forces.  But  the 
area  AB^K  (by  Corol.  3,  Lem.  VII  and  VIII,  Book  I)  is  to  the  area  Bkq 
as  
 by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to

The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other 
particle  of  matter,  icith  a  force  inversely  proportional  to  the 
squares  of  their  distances — is  the  discovery  w?  ich  characterizes 
The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo

force  is  not  directed  from  P  to  T  ;  and,  secondly,  because  it  is  not  recipro 
cally  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  distance  PT.  These  things  being 
premised,  it  is  manifest  that  the  areas  are  then  most  nearly  proportional  to 
the  times,  when  that  third  force  is  the  least  possible,  the  rest  preserving 
their  former  quantity  ;  and  that  the  orbit  PAB  does  then  approach  nearest 
to  the  elliptical  figure  above-mentioned,  when  both  the  second  and  third, 
but  especially  the  third  force,  is  the  least  possible;  the  first  force  remain 
ing  in  its  former  quantity. 
Let  the  accelerative  attraction  of  the  body  T  towards  S  be  expressed  by 
the  line  SN  ;  then  if  the  accelerative  attractions  SM  and  SN  were  equal, 
these,  attracting  the  bodies  T  and  P  equally  and  in  parallel  directions 
would  not  at  all  change  their  situation  with  respect  to  each  other.  The  mo 
tions  of  the  bodies  between  themselves  would  be  the  same  in  that  case  as  if 
those  attractions  did  not  act  at  all,  by  Cor.  6,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion.  And, 
by  a  like  reasoning,  if  the  attraction  SN  is  less  than  the  attraction  SM,  it 
will  take  away  out  of  the  attraction  SM  the  part  SN,  so  that  there  will  re 
main  only  the  part  (of  the  attraction)  MN  to  disturb  the  proportionality  of 
the  areas  and  times,  and  the  elliptical  figure  of  the  orbit.  And  in  like 
manner  if  the  attraction  SN  be  greater  than  the  attraction  SM,  the  pertur 
bation  of  the  orbit  and  proportion  will  be  produced  by  the  difference  MN 
alone.  After  this  manner  the  attraction  SN  reduces  always  the  attraction

Projectiles  excite  a  motion  in  fluids  as  they  pass  through  them,  and  this 
motion  arises  from  the  excess  of  the  pressure  of  the  fluid  at  the  fore  parts 
of  the  projectile  above  the  pressure  of  the  same  at  the  hinder  parts :  and 
cannot  be  less  in  mediums  infinitely  fluid  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  quick 
silver,  in  proportion  to  the  density  of  matter  in  each.  Now  this  excess  of 
pressure  does,  in  proportion  to  its  quantity,  not  only  excite  a  motion  in  the 
fluid,  but  also  acts  upon  the  projectile  so  as  to  retard  its  motion  ;  and  there 
fore  the  resistance  in  every  fluid  is  as  the  motion  excited  by  the  projectile 
in  the  fluid ;  and  cannot  be  less  in  the  most  subtile  aether  in  proportion  to 
the  density  of  that  aether,  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  Quicksilver,  in  pro 
portion  to  the  densities  of  those  fluids.

A  pressure  is  not  propagated  through  a  fluid  in  rectilinear  directions 
unless  ichere  the  particles  of  the  fluid  lie  in  a  right  line. 
If  the  particles  a,  b}  c,  d,  e,  lie  in  a  right  line,  the  pres 
sure  may  be  indeed  directly  propagated  from  a  to  e  ;  but 
then  the  particle  e  will  urge  the  obliquely  posited  parti

not  sustain  this  pressure,  unless  they  be  supported  by  the 
particles  h  and  k  lying  beyond  them ;  but  the  particles 
that  support  them  are  also  pressed  by  them ;  and  those  particles  cannot 
sustain  that  pressure,  without  being  supported  by,  and  pressing  upon,  those 
particles  that  lie  still  farther,  as  /  and  m,  and  so  on  in  itiflnitum.  There

And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving 
in  any  fluids  whatsoever,  though  of  the  most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris 
paribus,  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids. 
These  things  being  thus  established,  we  may  now  determine  what  part 
of  its  motion  any  globe  projected  in  any  fluid  whatsoever  would  nearly  lose 
in  a  given  time.  Let  D  be  the  diameter  of  the  globe,  and  V  its  velocity 
at  the  beginning  of  its  motion,  and  T  the  time  in  which  a  globe  with  the 
velocity  V  can  describe  in  vacua  a  space  that  is,  to  the  space  |D  as  the 
density  of  the  globe  to  the  density  of  the  fluid  ;  and  the  globe  projected

logarithm  of  the  number  — ~ —  multiplied  by  the  number  2,302585093  is 
to  the  number  7^,  by  Cor.  7,  Prop.  XXXV.  In  slow  motions  the  resist 
ance  may  be  a  little  less,  because  the  figure  of  a  globe  is  more  adapted  to 
motion  than  the  figure  of  a  cylinder  described  with  the  same  diameter.  In 
swift  motions  the  resistance  may  be  a  little  greater,  because  the  elasticity 
and  compression  of  the  fluid  do  not  increase  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
velocity.  But  these  little  niceties  I  take  no  notice  of. 
And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division

SCHOLIUM. 
The  resistance  of  spherical  bodies  in  fluids  arises  partly  from  the  tena 
city,  partly  from  the  attrition,  and  partly  from  the  density  of  the  medium. 
And  that  part  of  the  resistance  which  arises  from  the  density  of  the  fluid 
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of 
gravity,  and  subduct  it  when  the  body  descends  in  a  right  line.  One 
might  also  go  on  to  the  motion  of  bodies  whi
n  a  medium  whose  distant  parts  do  not  fly  from  each  other,  are  as 
the  squares  of  the  diameters,  the  resistances  made  to  bodies  moving  with 
very  great  and  equal  velocities  in  an  elastic  fluid  will  be  as  the  squares  of 
the  diameters,  nearly. 
COR.  5.  And  since  similar,  equal,  and  equally  swift  bodies,  moving 
through  mediums  of  the  same  density,  whose  particles  do  not  fly  from  each 
other  mutually,  will  strike  against  an  equal  quantity  of  matter  in  equal 
times,  whether  the  particles  of  which  the  medium  consists  be  more  and 
smaller,  or  fewer  and  greater,  and  therefore  impress  on  that  matter  an  equal 
quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an 
equal  re-action  from  the  same,  that  is,  are  equally  resisted ;  it  is  manifest, 
also,  that  in  elastic  fluids  of  the  same  density,  when  the  bodies  move  with 
extreme  swiftness,  their  resistances  are  nearly  equal,  whether  the  fluids 
consist  of  gross  parts,  or  of  parts  ever  so  subtile.  For  the  resistance  of 
projectiles  moving  with  exceedingly  great  celerities  is  not  much  diminished 
by  the  subtilty  of  the  medium. 
COR.  G.  All  these  things  are  so  in  fluids  whose  elastic  force  takes  its  rise 
from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles.  But  if  that  force  arise  from 
some  other  cause,  as  from  the  expansion  of  the  particles  after  the  manner 
of  wool,  or  the  boughs  of  trees,  or  any  other  cause,  by  which  the  particles 
are  hindered  from  moving  freely  among  themselves,  the  resistance,  by 
reason  of  the  lesser  fluidity  of  the  medium,  will  be  greater  than  in  the 
Corollaries  above.

little  more  resistance  than  if  they  were  acu*-e  at  the  head  and  tail.  And 
bodies  moving  in  elastic  fluids,  if  they  are  obtuse  behind  and  before,  con 
dense  the  fluid  a  little  more  at  their  fore  parts,  and  relax  the  same  at  theii 
hinder  parts ;  and  therefore  meet  also  with  a  little  more  resistance  than  ii 
they  were  acute  at  the  head  and  tail.  But  in  these  Lemmas  and  Proposi 
tions  we  are  not  treating  of  elastic  but  non-elastic  fluids;  not  of  bodies 
floating  on  the  surface  of  the  fluid,  but  deeply  immersed  therein.  And 
when  the  resistance  of  bodies  in  non-elastic  fluids  is  once  known,  we  may 
then  augment  this  resistance  a  little  in  elastic  fluids,  as  our  air;  and  in 
the  surfaces  of  stagnating  fluids,  as  lakes  and  seas.

If  a  globe  move  uniformly  forward  in  a  compressed,  infinite,  and  no?t'

The  bodies,  by  the  last  Theorem,  will  be  moved  in  the  same  manner  as 
if  they  were  attracted  by  a  third  placed  in  the  common  centre  of  their

ning  of  their  motion,  and  therefore  (by  Cor.  4,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will 
be  always  quiescent.  The  motions  of  the  bodies  are  therefore  to  be  deter 
mined  (by  Prob.  XXV)  in  the  same  manner  as  if  they  were  impelled  by 
forces  tending  to  that  centre:  and  then  we  shall  have  the  motions  of  the

PROPOSITION  VIII.     THEOREM   VIII. 
Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of 
the  particles  are  unequal,  and  their  situation  dissimilar.     But  by  the  help 
of  Prop.  LXXV  and  LXXVI,  Book  I,  and  their  Corollaries,  I  was  at  last 
satisfied  of  the  truth  of  the  Proposition,  as  it  now  lies  before  us. 
COR.  1.  Hence  we  may  find  and  compare  together  the  weights  of  bodies 
towards  different  planets  ;  for  the  weights  of  bodies  revolving  in  circles 
about  planets  are  (by  Cor.  2,  Prop.  IV,  Book  I)  as  the  diameters  of  the 
circles  directly,  and  the  squares  of  their  periodic  times  reciprocally ;  and 
their  weights  at  the  surfaces  of  the  planets,  or  at  any  other  distances  from 
their  centres,  are  (by  this  Prop.)  greater  or  less  in  the  reciprocal  duplicate 
proportion  of  the  distances.  Thus  from  the  periodic  times  of  Venus,  re

COR.  5.  The  power  of  gravity  is  of  a  different  nature  from  the  power  of 
magnetism  ;  for  the  magnetic  attraction  is  not  as  the  matter  attracted. 
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by  the  magnet ;  others  less ;  most  bodies 
not  at  all.  The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be 
increased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity 
of  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet 
decreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the 
distance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. 
PROPOSITION  VII.     THEOREM  VII. 
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to 
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. 
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law 
III)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  par

more  or  less  diminution  ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba 
ble  :  and,  in  order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of  diminution 
might  be,  he  considered  that  if  the  moon  be  retained  in  her  orbit 
by  the  force  of  gravity,  the  primary  planets  must  also  be  carried 
round  the  sun  by  the  like  power;  and,  by  comparing  the  periods 
of  the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun,  he  found 
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity, 
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in 
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the 
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now 
was  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?  Was  such  a  force,  em 
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to  the  moon,  sufficient,  when 
diminished  as  the  square  of  the  distance,  to  retain  her  in  her 
orbit  ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he  compared  the  space 
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall,  in  a  second  of  time,  at  a  given 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  namely,  at  its  surface,  with 
the  space  through  which  the  moon  falls,  as  it  were,  to  the  earth, 
in  the  same  time,  while  revolving  in  a  circular  orbit.  He  was 
absent  from  books  ;  and,  therefore,  adopted,  in  computing  the 
earth's  diameter,  the  common  estimate  of  sixty  miles  to  a  degree 
of  latitude  as  then  in  use  among  geographers  and  navigators. 
The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex 
pectations  ;  hence,  he  concluded  that  some  other  cause,  beyond  the 
reach  of  observation — analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des 
cartes — joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the 
rnooil.  Though  by  no  means  satisfied,  he  yet  aband
 by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any

sistance  of  the  body  E  to  the  resistance  of  the  body  G.  Let  the  bodies  1) 
and  F  be  equally  swift,  as  also  the  bodies  E  and  G ;  and,  augmenting  the 
velocities  of  the^bodies  D  arid  F  in  any  ratio,  and  diminishing  the  forces 
of  the  particles  of  the  medium  B  in  the  duplicate  of  the  same  ratio,  the 
medium  B  will  approach  to  the  form  and  condition  of  the  medium  C  at 
pleasure ;  and  therefore  the  resistances  of  the  equal  and  equally  swift 
bodies  E  and  G  in  these  mediums  will  perpetually  approach  to  equality 
so  that  their  difference  will  at  last  become  less  than  any  given.  There 
fore  since  the  resistances  of  the  bodies  D  and  F  are  to  each  other  as  the 
resistances  of  the  bodies  E  and  G,  those  will  also  in  like  manner  approach 
to  the  ratio  of  equality.  Therefore  the  bodies  1)  and  F,  when  they  move 
with  very  great  swiftness,  meet  with  resistances  very  nearly  equal;  and 
therefore  since  the  resistance  of  the  body  F  is  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
velocity,  the  resistance  of  the  body  D  will  be  nearly  in  the  same  ratio. 
Con.  3.  The  resistance  of  a  body  moving  very  swift  in  an  elastic  fluid 
is  almost  the  same  as  if  the  parts  of  the  fluid  were  destitute  of  their  cen 
trifugal  forces,  and  did  not  fly  from  each  other;  if  so  be  that  the  elasti 
city  of  the  fluid  arise  from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles,  and  the 
velocity  be  so  great  as  not  to  allow  the  particles  time  enough  to  act. 
COR.  4.  Therefore,  since  the  resistances  of  similar  and  equally  swift 
bodies,  in  a  medium  whose  distant  parts  do  not  fly  from  each  other,  are  as 
the  squares  of  the  diameters,  the  resistances  made  to  bodies  moving  with 
very  great  and  equal  velocities
on  will  be  evident,  where  the  gravity  of  the 
fluid  decreases  in  any  assigned  ratio  of  the  distance  from  the  centre,  and 
also  where  the  fluid  is  more  rare  above  and  denser  below.  Q.E.D. 
COR.  1.  Therefore  the  bottom  is  not  pressed  by  the  whole  weight  of  the 
incumbent  fluid,  but  only  sustains  that  part  of  it  which  is  described  in  the 
Proposition  ;  the  rest  of  the  weight  being  sustained  archwise  by  the  spheri 
cal  figure  of  the  fluid. 
COR.  2.  The  quantity  of  the  pressure  is  the  same  always  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  centre,  whether  the  superficies  pressed  be  parallel  to  the 
horizon,  or  perpendicular,  or  oblique ;  or  whether  the  fluid,  continued  up 
wards  from  the  compressed  superficies,  rises  perpendicularly  in  a  rectilinear 
direction,  or  creeps  obliquely  through  crooked  cavities  and  canals,  whether 
those  passages  be  regular  or  irregular,  wide  or  narrow.  That  the  pressure 
is  not  altered  by  any  of  these  circumstances,  may  be  collected  by  applying 
the  demonstration  of  this  Theorem  to  the  several  cases  of  fluids. 
COR.  3.  From  the  same  demonstration  it  may  also  be  collected  (by  Prop. 
XIX),  that  the  parts  of  a  heavy  fluid  acquire  no  motion  among  themselvei 
by  the  pressure  of  the  incumbent  veight,  except  that  motion  which  arises 
from  condensation.

His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven 
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor 
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes 
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his 
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New 
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug 
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669. 
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ; 
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis 
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science, 
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name. 
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method 
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities 
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation ;  among  the 
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria ;  among  the 
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis. 
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la- 
hours  of  his  predecessors :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved 
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented 
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this 
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination 
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their 
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing 
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as 
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor

to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines

the  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan 
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest. 
It  is  true,  that  the  action  of  Jupiter  upon  Saturn  is  not  to  be  neglected; 
for  the  force  of  gravity  towards  Jupiter  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  towards 
the  sun  (at  equal  distances,  Cor.  2,  Prop.  VIII)  as  1  to  1067;  and  therefore 
in  the  conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  because  the  distance  of  Saturn 
from  Jupiter  is  to  the  distance  of  Saturn  from  the  sun  almost  as  4  to  9,  the 
gravity  of  Saturn  towards  Jupiter  will  be  to  the  gravity  of  Saturn  towards 
the  sun  as  81  to  16  X  1067;  or,  as  1  to  about  21 1.  And  hence  arises  a 
perturbation  of  the  orb  of  Saturn  in  every  conjunction  of  this  planet  with 
Tupiter,  so  sensible,  that  astronomers  are  puzzled  with  it.  As  the  planet

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to

is  differently  situated  in  these  conjunctions,  its  eccentricity  is  sometimes 
augmented,  sometimes  diminished;  its  aphelion  is  sometimes  carried  for 
ward,  sometimes  backward,  and  its  mean  motion  is  by  turns  accelerated  and 
retarded ;  yet  the  whole  error  in  its  motion  about  the  sun,  though  arising 
from  so  great  a  force,  may  be  almost  avoided  (except  in  the  mean  motion) 
by  placing  the  lower  focus  of  its  orbit  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of 
Jupiter  and  the  sun  (according  to  Prop.  LXVII,  Book  I),  and  therefore  that 
error,  when  it  is  greatest,  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes ;  and  the  greatest 
error  in  the  mean  motion  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes  yearly.  But  in  the 
conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  the  accelerative  forces  of  gravity  of  the 
sun  towards  Saturn,  of  Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  and  of  Jupiter  towards  the 
sun,  are  almost  as  16,  81,  and  -       ~o^~~       — >  or  156609:  and  therefore 
the  difference  of  the  forces  of  gravity  of  the  sun  towards  Saturn,  and  of 
Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  towards  the 
sun  as  65  to  156609,  or  as  1  to  2409.  But  the  greatest  power  of  Saturn 
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of 
Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common 
centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth  and  moon  moves  in  an  ellipsis  about  the  sun 
in  the  focus  thereof,  and,  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun,  describes  areas  pro 
portional  to  the  times  of  description.  But  the  earth  in  the  mean  time  by

the  said  common  laws  of  attraction.  Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies 
to  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance 
from  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop.  XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it 
would  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in 
.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in 
a  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as 
that  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, 
Jupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon 
together  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing 
happens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts 
(p.  75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose.  To  hinder  such  a 
descent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required.  And  hence  depends  the 
force  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the 
planets.  Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of 
their  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de 
scend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded 
by  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the 
former  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths 
would  descend  to  the  sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, 
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor 
become  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are 
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to 
revolve  in  their  orbits,  are  
apparent  geocentric  motion,  we  infer  (by  Prop.  Ill 
Cor.  IV)  that  the  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  turned  out  of  a  rectilinear  course, 
and  made  to  revolve  in  an  orb,  is  not  directed  to  the  centre  of  the  earth. 
And  the  same  argument  holds  good  in  Mars  and  in  Saturn.  Another  centre 
of  these  forces  is  therefore  to  be  looked  for  (by  Prop.  II  and  III,  and  the 
Corollaries  of  the  latter),  about  which  the  areas  described  by  radii  inter 
vening  may  be  equable ;  and  that  this  is  the  sun,  we  have  proved  already 
in  Mars  and  Saturn  nearly,  but  accurately  enough  in  Jupiter.  It  may  be 
alledged  that  the  sun  and  planets  are  impelled  by  some  other  force  equally 
and  in  the  direction  of  parallel  lines ;  but  by  such  a  force  (by  Cor.  VI  of 
the  Laws  of  Motion)  no  change  would  happen  in  the  situation  of  the 
planets  one  to  another,  nor  any  sensible  eifect  follow  :  but  our  business  is 
with  the  causes  of  sensible  effects.  Let  us,  therefore,  neglect  every  such 
force  as  imaginary  and  precarious,  and  of  no  use  in  the  phenomena  of  the 
heavens ;  and  the  whole  remaining  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  impelled  will 
be  directed  (by  Prop.  Ill,  Cor.  I)  to  the  centre  of  the  sun. 
The  distances  of  the  planets  from  the  sun  come  out  the  same,  whether, 
with  Tycho,  we  place  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  system,  or  the  sun  with 
Copernicus  :  and  we  have  already  proved  that  these  distances  are  true  ir. 
Jupiter. 
Kepler  and  Bullialdiis  have,  with  great  care  (p.  388),  determined  the 
listances  of  the  planets  from  the  sun ;  and  hence  it  is  that  their  table.-?
  another  force  different  from  that, 
then  bodies  descending  to  the  earth  with  the  joint  impulse  of  both  forces 
would  fall  with  a  double  velocity,  and  in  the  space  of  one  second  of  time 
would  describe  30^  Paris  feet ;  altogether  against  experience. 
This  calculus  is  founded  on  the  hypothesis  of  the  earth's  standing  still ; 
for  if  both  earth  and  moon  move  about  the  sun.  and  at  the  same  time  about 
their  common  centre  of  gravity,  the  distance  of  the  centres  of  the  moon  and 
earth  from  one  another  will  be  6(H  semi-diameters  of  the  earth  ;  as  may 
be  found  by  a  computation  from  Prop.  LX,  Book  I. 
SCHOLIUM. 
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by 
the  foregoing  computation.  Therefore  if  the  same  little  moon  should  be 
deserted  by  its  centrifugal  force  that  carries  it  through  its  orb,  and  so  be
upon  Jupiter  and 
all  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights.  And  the  same  thing 
is  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in  re 
spect  of  the  moon,  as  appears  from  Cor.  II  and  III,  Prop.  LXV.  Arid, 
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for 
if  the  action  was  greater  upon  some  sort  of  particles  than  upon  others  than 
in  proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter,  it  would  be  also  greater  or  less 
upon  the  whole  planets  not  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  only,  but  like 
wise  of  the  sort  of  the  matter  more  copiously  found  in  one  and  more 
sparingly  in  another. 
In  such  bodies  as  are  found  on  our  earth  of  very  different  sorts,  I  exam 
ined  this  analogy  with  great  accuracy  (p.  343,  344). 
If  the  action  of  the  circum-terrestrial  force  is  proportional  to  the  bodies 
to  be  moved,  it  will  (by  the  Second  Law  of  Motion)  move  them  with  equal 
velocity  in  equal  times,  and  will  make  all  bodies  let  fall  to  descend  through 
equal  spaces  in  equal  times,  and  all  bodies  hung  by  equal  threads  to  vibrate 
in  equal  times.  If  the  action  of  the  force  was  greater,  the  times  would  be 
less ;  if  that  was  less,  these  would  be  greater. 
But  it  has  been  long  ago  observed  by  others,  that  (allowance  being  made 
for  the  small  resistance  of  the  air)  all  bodies  descend  through  equal  spaces

But  I  should  be  glad  the  diameters  of  the  planets  were  more  accurately 
measured  ;  and  that  may  be  done,  if  a  lamp,  set  at  a  great  distance,  is  made 
to  shine  through  a  circular  hole,  and  both  the  hole  and  the  light  of  the 
lamp  are  so  diminished  that  the  spectrum  may  appear  through  the  telescope 
just  like  the  planet,  and  may  be  defined  by  the  same  measure :  then  the 
diameter  of  the  hole  will  be  to  its  distance  from  the  objective  glass  as  the 
true  diameter  of  the  planet  to  its  distance  from  us.  The  light  of  the  lamp 
may  be  diminished  by  the  interposition  either  of  pieces  of  cloth,  or  of 
smoked  glass. 
Of  kin  to  the  analogy  we  have  been  describing,  there  is  another  observed 
between  the  forces  and  the  bodies  attracted  (p.  395,  396,  397).  Since  the 
action  of  the  centripetal  force  upon  the  planets  decreases  in  the  duplicate 
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it 
was  not  that  the  circum-solar  force  was  equally  exerted  upon  Jupiter  and 
all  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights.  And  the  same  thing 
is  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in

so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a 
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won 
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies." 
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be 
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred 
years  before  this  memorable  birth. 
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com 
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with 
small  one  which  she  possessed  at  Sewstern,  in  Leicestershire,  yield 
ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum, 
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa 
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years, 
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care 
of  her  own  mother. 
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; 
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at 
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. 
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- 
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary. 
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con 
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no 
charms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the 
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem 
ingly  dull  student  gave  him  a  severe

"  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  son  of  John  Newton,  Lord  of  the  Manor 
of  Woolsthorpe,  was  born  in  this  room,  on  the  25th  of  December, 
1642."

years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled ;  and,  in 
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}' 
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity. 
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state 
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most 
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal 
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu 
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean 
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the 
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid, 
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably 
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was 
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge. 
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who 
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose. 
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand 
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces 
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve 
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern 
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father 
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable 
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the 
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit ;  and  the  other, 
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit, 
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con 
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he

chiefly,  in  the  possession  of  the  family  of  the  Earl  of  Portsmouth, 
through  the  Viscountess  Lymington. 
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che 
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are 
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the 
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  Edinburgh. 
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke 
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in 
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: — " 'Tis  built  of  stone, 
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good 
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-, 
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger 
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University. 
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of 
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down 
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr 
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir 
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple- 
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned 
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed 
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved 
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with 
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white 
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the

of  discovery — the  stirring  elements  of  that  wondrous  spirit, 
which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through 
deep  onward  through  deep  of  Nature's  mysteries,  unlocking  her 
strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere  si 
lently  conquering. 
Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures, 
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn, 
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He 
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making 
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated, 
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early 
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She 
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe ;  but 
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham. 
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same 
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per 
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the 
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed, 
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune 
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar 
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated 
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and 
kindness. 
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took 
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen 
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, 
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him 
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage 
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When
se  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common. 
I.  Absolute,  true,  and  mathematical  time,  of  itself,  and  from  its  own  na 
ture  flows  equably  without  regard  to  anything  external,  and  by  another 
name  is  called  duration  :  relative,  apparent,  and  common  time,  is  some  sen 
sible  and  external  (whether  accurate  or  unequable)  measure  of  duration  by 
the  means  of  motion,  which  is  commonly  used  instead  of  true  time ;  such 
as  an  hour,  a  day,  a  month,  a  year. 
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which

tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter. 
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions. 
But  because  the  parts  of  space  cannot  be  seen,  or  distinguished  from  one 
another  by  our  senses,  therefore  in  their  stead  we  use  sensible  measures  of 
them.  For  from  the  positions  and  distances  of  things  from  any  body  con 
sidered  as  immovable,  we  define  all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such 
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some 
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absol
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, 
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is 
really  at  rest,  the  body,  which  relatively  rests  in  the  ship,  will  really  and 
absolutely  move  with  the  same  velocity  which  the  ship  has  on  the  earth. 
But  if  the  earth  also  moves,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  the  body  will 
arise,  partly  from  the  true  motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space ;  partly 
from  the  relative  motion  of  the  ship  on  the  earth ;  and  if  the  body  moves 
also  relatively  in  the  ship ;  its  true  motion  will  arise,  partly  from  the  true 
motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space,  and  partly  from  the  relative  mo 
tions  as  well  of  the  ship  on  the  earth,  as  of  the  body  in  the  ship  ;  and  from 
these  relative  motions  will  arise  the  relative  motion  of  the  body  on  the 
earth.     As  if  that  part  of  the  earth,  where  the  ship  is,  was  truly  moved 
toward  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10010  parts;  while  the  ship  itself,  with 
a  fresh  gale,  and  full  sails,  is  carried  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  ex 
pressed  by  10  of  those  parts  ;  but  a  sailor  walks  in  the  ship  towards  the 
east,  with  1  part  of  the  said  velocity ;  then  the  sailor  will  be  moved  truly 
in  immovable  space  towards  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10001  parts,  and 
relatively  on  the  earth  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  of  9  of  those  parts. 
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motion
able  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. 
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the 
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no 
means  consist  in  such  relations. 
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the

absolutely  understood,  it  will  be  perpetually  mutable. 
III.  Place  is  a  part  of  space  which  a  body  takes  up,  and  is  according  to 
the  space,  either  absolute  or  relative.   I  say,  a  part  of  space ;  not  the  situation, 
nor  the  external  surface  of  the  body.     For  the  places  of  equal  solids  are 
always  equal ;  but  their  superfices,  by  reason  of  their  dissimilar  figures,  are 
often  unequal.     Positions  properly  have  no  quantity,  nor  are  they  so  much 
the  places  themselves,  as  the  properties  of  places.     The  motion  of  the  whole 
is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  the  parts ;  that  is,  the 
translation  of  the  whole,  out  of  its  place,  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum 
of  the  translations  of  the  parts  out  of  their  places ;  and  therefore  the  place 
of  the  whole  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  places  of  the  parts,  and 
for  that  reason,  it  is  internal,  and  in  the  whole  body. 
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the 
ship,  or  of  its  cavity.     But  real,  absolute  rest,  is  the  continuance  of  the 
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, 
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is 
really  at  rest,  th

Nec  fas  est  proprius  mortal?  attingere  Divos. — HALLEY. 
FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling 
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control 
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din 
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and 
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and 
moral  truth ;  ascending  height  after  height ;  sweeping  afar  over 
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en 
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly 
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose, 
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its 
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous 
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo 
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis 
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect 
God. 
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain, 
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De 
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the 
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New 
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his 
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi 
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the 
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and 
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness, 
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise 
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON,  13 
turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed
all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such 
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some 
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absolute  places  and  motions, 
we  use  relative  ones;  and  that  without  any  inconvenience  in  common  af 
fairs  ;  but  in  philosophical  disquisitions,  we  ought  to  abstract  from  our 
senses,  and  consider  things  themselves,  distinct  from  what  are  only  sensible 
measures  of  them.  For  it  may  be  that  there  is  no  body  really  at  rest,  to 
which  the  places  and  motions  of  others  may  be  referred. 
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions. 
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena.

!
• Using tyres that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
• Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tyres inflation and
maintenance. |  |

Tubeless tyres have some self-sealing ability if 
they are punctured. However, because leakage 
is often very slow, you should look closely for 
punctures whenever a tyre is not fully inflated.
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre.

 ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets 
in  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni 
versally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot 
mutual  gravitation.  For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with 
more  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen 
etrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex 
periments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.  Not  that  I  affirm  gravity  to  be 
essential  to  bodies  :  by  their  vis  insita  I  mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz. 
This  is  immutable.  Their  gravity  is  diminished  as  they  recede  from  the 
earth. 
RULE  IV. 
In  experimental  philosophy  we  are  to  look  upon  propositions  collected  by 
general  induction  from,  phenomena  as  accurately  or  very  nearly  true, 
notwithstanding  any  contrary  hypotheses  that  may  be  imagined,  till 
such  time  as  other  phenomena  occur,  by  which  they  may  either  be  made 
more  accurate,  or  liable  to  exceptions. 
This  rule  we  must  follow,  that  the  argument  of  induction  may  not  bf 
evaded  by  hypotheses.

LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON. 
the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to 
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min 
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  t
ion  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  part  will  be  to  the  gravity  towards  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole.  Q.E.D. 
COR,  1.  Therefore  the  force  of  gravity  towards  any  whole  planet  arises 
from,  and  is  compounded  of,  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its  parts. 
Magnetic  and  electric  attractions  afford  us  examples  of  this ;  for  all  at 
traction  towards  the  whole  arises  from  the  attractions  towards  the  several 
parts.  The  thing  may  be  easily  understood  in  gravity,  if  we  consider  a 
greater  planet,  as  formed  of  a  number  of  lesser  planets,  meeting  together  in 
one  globe ;  for  hence  it  would  appear  that  the  force  of  the  whole  must 
arise  from  the  forces  of  the  component  parts.  If  it  is  objected,  that,  ac 
cording  to  this  law,  all  bodies  with  us  must  mutually  gravitate  one  to 
wards  another,  whereas  no  such  gravitation  any  where  appears,  I  answer, 
that  since  the  gravitation  towards  these  bodies  is  to  the  gravitation  towards 
the  whole  earth  as  these  bodies  are  to  the  whole  earth,  the  gravitation  to 
wards  them  must  be  far  less  than  to  fall  under  the  observation  of  our  senses. 
COR.  2.  The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any 
body  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti 
cles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor.  3,  Prop.  LXXIV,  Book  I.
BOOK  Ill.J  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.  397 
By  bodies  of  the  same  density,  I  mean  those  whose  vires  inertia  are  in  the 
proportion  of  their  bulks. 
COR.  5.  The  power  of  gravity  is  of  a  different  nature  from  the  power  of 
magnetism  ;  for  the  magnetic  attraction  is  not  as  the  matter  attracted. 
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by  the  magnet ;  others  less ;  most  bodies 
not  at  all.  The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be 
increased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity 
of  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet 
decreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the 
distance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. 
PROPOSITION  VII.     THEOREM  VII. 
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to 
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. 
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law 
III)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  par

this  Book,  and  consult  such  of  the  remaining  Propositions  of  the 
first  two  Books,  as  the  references  in  this,  and  his  occasions  shall  re 
quire."  So  that  "  The  System  of  the  World"  is  composed  both 
"  in  a  popular  method,"  and  in  the  form  of  mathematical  Propo 
sitions. 
The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every 
particle  of  matter  is  attracted  by,  or  gravitates  to,  every  other 
particle  of  matter,  icith  a  force  inversely  proportional  to  the 
squares  of  their  distances — is  the  discovery  w?  ich  characterizes 
The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo 
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true. 
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of
h 
this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi 
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have 
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines. 
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the 
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy. 
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved 
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which 
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but 
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, 
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, 
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht 
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. 
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1), 
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the 
planets. 
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de 
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an 
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces 
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for
396  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK  II] 
planet  are  one  to  another  as  the  matter  in  the  several  parts;  for  if  some 
parts  did  gravitate  more,  others  less,  than  for  the  quantity  of  their  matter, 
then  the  whole  planet,  according  to  the  sort  of  parts  with  which  it  most 
abounds,  would  gravitate  more  or  less  than  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of 
matter  in  the  whole.  Nor  is  it  of  any  moment  whether  these  parts  are 
external  or  internal ;  for  if,  for  example,  we  should  imagine  the  terrestrial 
bodies  with  us  to  be  raised  up  to  the  orb  of  the  moon,  to  be  there  compared 
with  its  body  :  if  the  weights  of  such  bodies  were  to  the  weights  of  the  ex 
ternal  parts  of  the  moon  as  the  quantities  of  matter  in  the  one  and  in  the 
other  respectively  •  but  to  the  weights  of  the  internal  parts  in  a  greater  or 
less  proportion,  then  likewise  the  weights  of  those  bodies  would  be  to  the 
weight  of  the  whole  moon  in  a  greater  or  less  proportion;  against  what 
we  have  shewed  above. 
COR.  1.  Hence  the  weights  of  bodies  do  not  depend  upon  their  forms 
and  textures  ;  for  if  the  weights  could  be  altered  with  the  forms,  they 
would  be  greater  or  less,  according  to  the  variety  of  forms,  in  equal  matter ; 
altogether  against  experience. 
COR.  2.  Universally,  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the 
earth ;  and  the  weights  of  all,  at  equal  distances  from  the  earth's  centre. 
are  as  the  quantities  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain.  This  is  the 
quality  of  all  bodies  within  the  reach  of  our  experiments  ;  and  therefore 
(by  Rule  III)  to  be  affirmed  of  all  bodies  whatsoever.  If  the  ather,  or  anj 
other  body,  were  either  altogether  void  of  gravity,  or  were  to  gravitate  lesr 
in  proportion  to  its  quantit
356  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BoOK    11. 
Projectiles  excite  a  motion  in  fluids  as  they  pass  through  them,  and  this 
motion  arises  from  the  excess  of  the  pressure  of  the  fluid  at  the  fore  parts 
of  the  projectile  above  the  pressure  of  the  same  at  the  hinder  parts :  and 
cannot  be  less  in  mediums  infinitely  fluid  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  quick 
silver,  in  proportion  to  the  density  of  matter  in  each.  Now  this  excess  of 
pressure  does,  in  proportion  to  its  quantity,  not  only  excite  a  motion  in  the 
fluid,  but  also  acts  upon  the  projectile  so  as  to  retard  its  motion  ;  and  there 
fore  the  resistance  in  every  fluid  is  as  the  motion  excited  by  the  projectile 
in  the  fluid ;  and  cannot  be  less  in  the  most  subtile  aether  in  proportion  to 
the  density  of  that  aether,  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  Quicksilver,  in  pro 
portion  to  the  densities  of  those  fluids. 
SECTION  VIII. 
Of  motion  propagated  through  fluids. 
PROPOSITION  XLI.     THEOREM  XXXII. 
A  pressure  is  not  propagated  through  a  fluid  in  rectilinear  directions 
unless  ichere  the  particles  of  the  fluid  lie  in  a  right  line. 
If  the  particles  a,  b}  c,  d,  e,  lie  in  a  right  line,  the  pres 
sure  may  be  indeed  directly  propagated  from  a  to  e  ;  but 
then  the  particle  e  will  urge  the  obliquely  posited  parti 
te)  cles  /  and  g  obliquely,  and  those  particles  /  and  g  will 
not  sustain  this  pressure,  unless  they  be  supported  by  the 
particles  h  and  k  lying  beyond  them ;  but  the  particles 
that  support  them  are  also  pressed  by  them ;  and  those  particles  cannot 
sustain  that  pressure,  without  being  supported  by,  and  pressing  upon,  those 
particles  that  lie  still  farther,  as  /  and  m,  and  so  on  in  itiflnitum.  There

experiments  of  pendulums,  as  well  as  by  the  experiments  of  falling  bodies. 
And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving 
in  any  fluids  whatsoever,  though  of  the  most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris 
paribus,  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids. 
These  things  being  thus  established,  we  may  now  determine  what  part 
of  its  motion  any  globe  projected  in  any  fluid  whatsoever  would  nearly  lose 
in  a  given  time.  Let  D  be  the  diameter  of  the  globe,  and  V  its  velocity 
at  the  beginning  of  its  motion,  and  T  the  time  in  which  a  globe  with  the 
velocity  V  can  describe  in  vacua  a  space  that  is,  to  the  space  |D  as  the 
density  of  the  globe  to  the  density  of  the  fluid  ;  and  the  globe  projected

in  that  fluid  will,  in   any  other   time  t  lose  the  part  ™   ,  the   part

logarithm  of  the  number  — ~ —  multiplied  by  the  number  2,302585093  is 
to  the  number  7^,  by  Cor.  7,  Prop.  XXXV.  In  slow  motions  the  resist 
ance  may  be  a  little  less,  because  the  figure  of  a  globe  is  more  adapted  to 
motion  than  the  figure  of  a  cylinder  described  with  the  same  diameter.  In 
swift  motions  the  resistance  may  be  a  little  greater,  because  the  elasticity 
and  compression  of  the  fluid  do  not  increase  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
velocity.  But  these  little  niceties  I  take  no  notice  of. 
And  though  air.  water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division 
of  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in 
finitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make

SCHOLIUM. 
The  resistance  of  spherical  bodies  in  fluids  arises  partly  from  the  tena 
city,  partly  from  the  attrition,  and  partly  from  the  density  of  the  medium. 
And  that  part  of  the  resistance  which  arises  from  the  density  of  the  fluid 
is,  as  I  said,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ;  the  other  part,  which 
arises  from  the  tenacity  of  the  fluid,  is  uniform,  or  as  the  moment  of  the 
time  ;  and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to  the  motion  of  bodies,  whicli 
are  resisted  partly  by  an  uniform  force,  or  in  the  ratio  of  the  moments  of 
the  time,  and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.  But  it  is  suf 
ficient  to  have  cleared  the  way  to  this  speculation  in  Prop.  VIII  and  IX 
foregoing,  and  their  Corollaries.  For  in  those  Propositions,  instead  of  the 
uniform  resistance  made  to  an  ascending  body  arising  from  its  gravity, 
one  may  substitute  the  uniform  resistance  which  arises  from  the  tenacity 
of  the  medium,  when  the  body  moves  by  its  vis  insita  alone  ;  and  when  the 
body  ascends  in  a  right  line,  add  this  uniform  resistance  to  the  force  of

the  squares  of  the  diameters,  the  resistances  made  to  bodies  moving  with 
very  great  and  equal  velocities  in  an  elastic  fluid  will  be  as  the  squares  of 
the  diameters,  nearly. 
COR.  5.  And  since  similar,  equal,  and  equally  swift  bodies,  moving 
through  mediums  of  the  same  density,  whose  particles  do  not  fly  from  each 
other  mutually,  will  strike  against  an  equal  quantity  of  matter  in  equal 
times,  whether  the  particles  of  which  the  medium  consists  be  more  and 
smaller,  or  fewer  and  greater,  and  therefore  impress  on  that  matter  an  equal 
quantity  of  motion,  and  in  return  (by  the  3d  Law  of  Motion)  suffer  an 
equal  re-action  from  the  same,  that  is,  are  equally  resisted ;  it  is  manifest, 
also,  that  in  elastic  fluids  of  the  same  density,  when  the  bodies  move  with 
extreme  swiftness,  their  resistances  are  nearly  equal,  whether  the  fluids 
consist  of  gross  parts,  or  of  parts  ever  so  subtile.  For  the  resistance  of 
projectiles  moving  with  exceedingly  great  celerities  is  not  much  diminished 
by  the  subtilty  of  the  medium. 
COR.  G.  All  these  things  are  so  in  fluids  whose  elastic  force  takes  its  rise 
from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles.  But  if  that  force  arise  from 
some  other  cause,  as  from  the  expansion  of  the  particles  after  the  manner 
of  wool,  or  the  boughs  of  trees,  or  any  other  cause,  by  which  the  particles 
are  hindered  from  moving  freely  among  themselves,  the  resistance,  by 
reason  of  the  lesser  fluidity  of  the  medium,  will  be  greater  than  in  the 
Corollaries  above.

bodies  moving  in  elastic  fluids,  if  they  are  obtuse  behind  and  before,  con 
dense  the  fluid  a  little  more  at  their  fore  parts,  and  relax  the  same  at  theii

they  were  acute  at  the  head  and  tail.  But  in  these  Lemmas  and  Proposi 
tions  we  are  not  treating  of  elastic  but  non-elastic  fluids;  not  of  bodies 
floating  on  the  surface  of  the  fluid,  but  deeply  immersed  therein.  And 
when  the  resistance  of  bodies  in  non-elastic  fluids  is  once  known,  we  may 
then  augment  this  resistance  a  little  in  elastic  fluids,  as  our  air;  and  in 
the  surfaces  of  stagnating  fluids,  as  lakes  and  seas.

sistance  of  the  body  E  to  the  resistance  of  the  body  G.  Let  the  bodies  1) 
and  F  be  equally  swift,  as  also  the  bodies  E  and  G ;  and,  augmenting  the 
velocities  of  the^bodies  D  arid  F  in  any  ratio,  and  diminishing  the  forces 
of  the  particles  of  the  medium  B  in  the  duplicate  of  the  same  ratio,  the 
medium  B  will  approach  to  the  form  and  condition  of  the  medium  C  at 
pleasure ;  and  therefore  the  resistances  of  the  equal  and  equally  swift 
bodies  E  and  G  in  these  mediums  will  perpetually  approach  to  equality 
so  that  their  difference  will  at  last  become  less  than  any  given.  There 
fore  since  the  resistances  of  the  bodies  D  and  F  are  to  each  other  as  the 
resistances  of  the  bodies  E  and  G,  those  will  also  in  like  manner  approach 
to  the  ratio  of  equality.  Therefore  the  bodies  1)  and  F,  when  they  move 
with  very  great  swiftness,  meet  with  resistances  very  nearly  equal;  and 
therefore  since  the  resistance  of  the  body  F  is  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
velocity,  the  resistance  of  the  body  D  will  be  nearly  in  the  same  ratio. 
Con.  3.  The  resistance  of  a  body  moving  very  swift  in  an  elastic  fluid 
is  almost  the  same  as  if  the  parts  of  the  fluid  were  destitute  of  their  cen 
trifugal  forces,  and  did  not  fly  from  each  other;  if  so  be  that  the  elasti 
city  of  the  fluid  arise  from  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the  particles,  and  the 
velocity  be  so  great  as  not  to  allow  the  particles  time  enough  to  act. 
COR.  4.  Therefore,  since  the  resistances  of  similar  and  equally  swift 
bodies,  in  a  medium  whose  distant  parts  do  not  fly  from  each  other,  are  as 
the  squares  of  the  diameters,  the  resistances  made  to  bodies  moving  with 
very  great  and  equal  velocities
on  will  be  evident,  where  the  gravity  of  the 
fluid  decreases  in  any  assigned  ratio  of  the  distance  from  the  centre,  and 
also  where  the  fluid  is  more  rare  above  and  denser  below.  Q.E.D. 
COR.  1.  Therefore  the  bottom  is  not  pressed  by  the  whole  weight  of  the 
incumbent  fluid,  but  only  sustains  that  part  of  it  which  is  described  in  the 
Proposition  ;  the  rest  of  the  weight  being  sustained  archwise  by  the  spheri 
cal  figure  of  the  fluid. 
COR.  2.  The  quantity  of  the  pressure  is  the  same  always  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  centre,  whether  the  superficies  pressed  be  parallel  to  the 
horizon,  or  perpendicular,  or  oblique ;  or  whether  the  fluid,  continued  up 
wards  from  the  compressed  superficies,  rises  perpendicularly  in  a  rectilinear 
direction,  or  creeps  obliquely  through  crooked  cavities  and  canals,  whether 
those  passages  be  regular  or  irregular,  wide  or  narrow.  That  the  pressure 
is  not  altered  by  any  of  these  circumstances,  may  be  collected  by  applying 
the  demonstration  of  this  Theorem  to  the  several  cases  of  fluids. 
COR.  3.  From  the  same  demonstration  it  may  also  be  collected  (by  Prop. 
XIX),  that  the  parts  of  a  heavy  fluid  acquire  no  motion  among  themselvei 
by  the  pressure  of  the  incumbent  veight,  except  that  motion  which  arises 
from  condensation.
OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 
AXIOMS,  OR  LAWS  OF  MOTION. 
LAW  I. 
Hvery  body  perseveres  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  uniform  motion  in  a  ri^ht 
line,  unless  it  is  compelled  to  change  that  state  by  forces  impressed 
thereon. 
PROJECTILES  persevere  in  their  motions,  so  far  as  they  are  not  retarded 
by  the  resistance  of  the  air,  or  impelled  downwards  by  the  force  of  gravity 
A  top,  whose  parts  by  their  cohesion  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from 
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its  rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it  is  re 
tarded  by  the  air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  meeting 
with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro 
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time. 
LAW   II. 
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus 
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force 
is  impressed. 
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both. 
LAW  III. 
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction :  or  the  mu 
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di 
rected  to  contrary  parts.

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to 
sphere,  body  to  body,  particle  to  particle,  atom  to  mass,  the  min 
utest  part  to  the  stupendous  whole — each  t
  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly 
call  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both 
globes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. 
IV,  Prop.  LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each 
globe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. 
And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity 
of  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that 
other  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of 
the  two  (by  Cor.  II,  Prop.  LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which 
the  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is 
proportional.     And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now 
easy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves. 
From  comparing  the  forces  of  the  planets  one  with  another,  we  have 
above  seen  that  the  circum-solar  does  more  than  a  thousand  times  exceed 
all  the  rest ;  but  by  the  action  of  a  force  so  greab  it  is  unavoidable  but  that 
all  bodies  within,  nay,  and  far  beyond,  the  bounds  of  the  planetary  system 
must  descend  directly  to  the  sun,  unless  by  other  motions  they  are  impelled 
towards  other  parts :  nor  is  our  earth  to  be  excluded  from  the  number  of 
such  bodies :  for  certainly  the  moon  is  a  body  of  the  same  nature  with  the 
planets,  and  subject  to  the  same  attractions  with  the  other  planets,  seeing 
it  is  by  the  circum-terrestrial  force  that  it  is  retained  in  its  orbit.  But 
that  the  earth  and  moon  are  equally  attracted  towards  the  sun,  we  have 
above  proved ;  we  have  likewise  before  proved  that  all  bodies  are  subject  to
530 
THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. 
the  said  common  laws  of  attraction.  Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies 
to  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance 
from  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop.  XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it 
would  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in 
.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in 
a  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as 
that  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, 
Jupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon 
together  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing 
happens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts 
(p.  75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose.  To  hinder  such  a 
descent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required.  And  hence  depends  the 
force  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the 
planets.  Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of 
their  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de 
scend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded 
by  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the 
former  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths 
would  descend  to  the  sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, 
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor 
become  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are 
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to 
revolve  in  their  orbits,  are  
102  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III 
the  sun.  In  other  cases,  the  distances  of  those  centres  are  always  less :  and 
therefore,  since  that  centre  of  gravity  is  in  perpetual  rest,  the  sun,  accord 
ing  to  the  various  positions  of  the  planets,  must  perpetually  be  moved  every 
way,  but  will  never  recede  far  from  that  centre. 
Con.  Hence  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth,  the  sun,  and  all 
the  planets,  is  to  be  esteemed  the  centre  of  the  world ;  for  since  the  earth, 
the  sun,  and  all  the  planets,  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  and 
are  therefore,  according  to  their  powers  of  gravity,  in  perpetual  agitation, 
as  the  Laws  of  Motion  require,  it  is  plain  that  their  moveable  centres  can 
not  be  taken  for  the  immovable  centre  of  the  world.  If  that  body  were  to 
be  placed  in  the  centre,  towards  which  other  bodies  gravitate  most  (accord 
ing  to  common  opinion),  that  privilege  ought  to  be  allowed  to  the  sun;  but 
since  the  sun  itself  is  moved,  a  fixed  point  is  to  be  chosen  from  which  the 
centre  of  the  sun  recedes  least,  and  from  which  it  would  recede  yet 
less  if  the  body  of  the  sun  were  denser  and  greater,  and  therefore  less  apt 
to  be  moved. 
PROPOSITION  XIII.     THEOREM  XIII. 
The  planets  move  in  ellipses  tvhicli  have  their  common  focus  in  the  centre 
of  the  sini  ;  and,  by  radii  drawn,  to  tJtat  centre,  they  describe  areas  pro 
portion  al  to  the  times  of  description. 
We  have  discoursed  above  of  these  motions  from  the  Phenomena.  Now 
that  we  know  the  principles  on  which  they  depend,  from  those  principles 
we  deduce  the  motions  of  the  heavens  a  priori.  Because  the  weights  of 
the  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan 
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,

the  lower  apsis  with  an  angular  motion  of  180  deg.,  45  min.,  44  sec  ,  and 
this  angular  motion  being  repeated,  will  return  to  the  upper  apsis ;  and 
therefore  the  upper  apsis  in  each  revolution  will  go  forward  1  deg.,  31  min.,

So  much  for  the  motion  of  bodies  in  orbits  whose  planes  pass  through 
the  centre  of  force.  It  now  remains  to  determine  those  motions  in  eccen 
trical  planes.  For  those  authors  who  treat  of  the  motion  of  heavy  bodies 
used  to  consider  the  ascent  and  descent  of  such  bodies,  not  only  in  a  per 
pendicular  direction,  but  at  all  degrees  of  obliquity  upon  any  given  planes  ; 
and  for  the  same  reason  we  are  to  consider  in  this  place  the  motions  of 
bodies  tending  to  centres  by  means  of  any  forces  whatsoever,  when  those 
bodies  move  in  eccentrical  planes.  These  planes  are  supposed  to  be 
perfectly  smooth  and  polished,  so  as  not  to  retard  the  motion  of  the  bodies 
in  the  least.  Moreover,  in  these  demonstrations,  instead  of  the  planes  upon

Tn  two  spheres  mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the  other,  if  tlie  matter 
in  places  on  all  sides  round  about  and  equi-distant  from  the  centres  is 
similar,  the  weight  of  either  sphere  towards  the  other  will  be  recipro 
cally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres. 
After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did 
arise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its 
parts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the 
squares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re 
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the 
total  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the 
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should 
be  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of 
the  particles  are  unequal,  and  their  situation  dissimilar.     But  by  the  help 
of  Prop.  LXXV  and  LXXVI,  Book  I,  and  their  Corollaries,  I  was  at  last 
satisfied  of  the  truth  of  the  Proposition,  as  it  now  lies  before  us. 
COR.  1.  Hence  we  may  find  and  compare  together  the  weights  of  bodies 
towards  different  planets  ;  for  the  weights  of  bodies  revolving  in  circles 
about  planets  are  (by  Cor.  2,  Prop.  IV,  Book  I)  as  the  diameters  of  the 
circles  directly,  and  the  squares  of  their  periodic  times  reciprocally ;  and 
their  weights  at  the  surfaces  of  the  planets,  or  at  any  other  distances  from 
their  centres,  are  (by  this  Prop.)  greater  or  less  in  the  reciprocal  duplicate 
proportion  of  the  distances.  Thus  from  the  periodic  times  of  Venus,  re

COR.  5.  The  power  of  gravity  is  of  a  different  nature  from  the  power  of 
magnetism  ;  for  the  magnetic  attraction  is  not  as  the  matter  attracted. 
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by  the  magnet ;  others  less ;  most  bodies 
not  at  all.  The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be 
increased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity 
of  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet 
decreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the 
distance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. 
PROPOSITION  VII.     THEOREM  VII. 
That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to 
the  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. 
That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have 
proved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, 
considered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from 
the  centre  of  the  planet.  And  thence  (by  Prop.  LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its 
Corollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is 
proportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. 
Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any 
other  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the 
whole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law 
III)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B 
will,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; 
and  its  gravity  towards  any  one  par

more  or  less  diminution  ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba 
ble  :  and,  in  order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of  diminution 
might  be,  he  considered  that  if  the  moon  be  retained  in  her  orbit 
by  the  force  of  gravity,  the  primary  planets  must  also  be  carried 
round  the  sun  by  the  like  power;  and,  by  comparing  the  periods 
of  the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun,  he  found 
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity, 
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in 
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the 
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now 
was  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?  Was  such  a  force,  em 
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to  the  moon,  sufficient,  when 
diminished  as  the  square  of  the  distance,  to  retain  her  in  her 
orbit  ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he  compared  the  space 
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall,  in  a  second  of  time,  at  a  given 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  namely,  at  its  surface,  with 
the  space  through  which  the  moon  falls,  as  it  were,  to  the  earth, 
in  the  same  time,  while  revolving  in  a  circular  orbit.  He  was 
absent  from  books  ;  and,  therefore,  adopted,  in  computing  the 
earth's  diameter,  the  common  estimate  of  sixty  miles  to  a  degree 
of  latitude  as  then  in  use  among  geographers  and  navigators. 
The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex 
pectations  ;  hence,  he  concluded  that  some  other  cause,  beyond  the 
reach  of  observation — analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des 
cartes — joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the 
rnooil.  Though  by  no  means  satisfied,  he  yet  aband
 by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any 
direction,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the
  another  force  different  from  that, 
then  bodies  descending  to  the  earth  with  the  joint  impulse  of  both  forces 
would  fall  with  a  double  velocity,  and  in  the  space  of  one  second  of  time 
would  describe  30^  Paris  feet ;  altogether  against  experience. 
This  calculus  is  founded  on  the  hypothesis  of  the  earth's  standing  still ; 
for  if  both  earth  and  moon  move  about  the  sun.  and  at  the  same  time  about 
their  common  centre  of  gravity,  the  distance  of  the  centres  of  the  moon  and 
earth  from  one  another  will  be  6(H  semi-diameters  of  the  earth  ;  as  may 
be  found  by  a  computation  from  Prop.  LX,  Book  I. 
SCHOLIUM. 
The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained 
after  the  following  manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the 
earth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these 
moons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which 
Kepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal 
forces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre 
of  the  earth,  by  Prop.  I,  of  this  Book.  Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were 
very  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the 
highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, 
would  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that 
should  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by 
the  foregoing  computation.  Therefore  if  the  same  little  moon  should  be 
deserted  by  its  centrifugal  force  that  carries  it  through  its  orb,  and  so  be
upon  Jupiter  and 
all  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights.  And  the  same  thing 
is  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in  re 
spect  of  the  moon,  as  appears  from  Cor.  II  and  III,  Prop.  LXV.  Arid, 
therefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal 
upon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of 
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same 
upon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for 
if  the  action  was  greater  upon  some  sort  of  particles  than  upon  others  than 
in  proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter,  it  would  be  also  greater  or  less 
upon  the  whole  planets  not  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  only,  but  like 
wise  of  the  sort  of  the  matter  more  copiously  found  in  one  and  more 
sparingly  in  another. 
In  such  bodies  as  are  found  on  our  earth  of  very  different  sorts,  I  exam 
ined  this  analogy  with  great  accuracy  (p.  343,  344). 
If  the  action  of  the  circum-terrestrial  force  is  proportional  to  the  bodies 
to  be  moved,  it  will  (by  the  Second  Law  of  Motion)  move  them  with  equal 
velocity  in  equal  times,  and  will  make  all  bodies  let  fall  to  descend  through 
equal  spaces  in  equal  times,  and  all  bodies  hung  by  equal  threads  to  vibrate 
in  equal  times.  If  the  action  of  the  force  was  greater,  the  times  would  be 
less ;  if  that  was  less,  these  would  be  greater. 
But  it  has  been  long  ago  observed  by  others,  that  (allowance  being  made 
for  the  small  resistance  of  the  air)  all  bodies  descend  through  equal  spaces
deduce  the  motions  of  the  heavens  a  priori.  Because  the  weights  of 
the  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan 
ces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did 
not  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having 
the  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional 
to  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop.  I  and  XI,  and  Cor.  1,  Prop.  XIII, 
Book  I.  But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so 
very  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop.  LXVI,  Book  I,  they 
less  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if 
those  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest. 
It  is  true,  that  the  action  of  Jupiter  upon  Saturn  is  not  to  be  neglected; 
for  the  force  of  gravity  towards  Jupiter  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  towards 
the  sun  (at  equal  distances,  Cor.  2,  Prop.  VIII)  as  1  to  1067;  and  therefore 
in  the  conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  because  the  distance  of  Saturn 
from  Jupiter  is  to  the  distance  of  Saturn  from  the  sun  almost  as  4  to  9,  the 
gravity  of  Saturn  towards  Jupiter  will  be  to  the  gravity  of  Saturn  towards 
the  sun  as  81  to  16  X  1067;  or,  as  1  to  about  21 1.  And  hence  arises  a 
perturbation  of  the  orb  of  Saturn  in  every  conjunction  of  this  planet  with 
Tupiter,  so  sensible,  that  astronomers  are  puzzled  with  it.  As  the  planet

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to

is  differently  situated  in  these  conjunctions,  its  eccentricity  is  sometimes 
augmented,  sometimes  diminished;  its  aphelion  is  sometimes  carried  for 
ward,  sometimes  backward,  and  its  mean  motion  is  by  turns  accelerated  and 
retarded ;  yet  the  whole  error  in  its  motion  about  the  sun,  though  arising 
from  so  great  a  force,  may  be  almost  avoided  (except  in  the  mean  motion) 
by  placing  the  lower  focus  of  its  orbit  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of 
Jupiter  and  the  sun  (according  to  Prop.  LXVII,  Book  I),  and  therefore  that 
error,  when  it  is  greatest,  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes ;  and  the  greatest 
error  in  the  mean  motion  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes  yearly.  But  in  the 
conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  the  accelerative  forces  of  gravity  of  the 
sun  towards  Saturn,  of  Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  and  of  Jupiter  towards  the 
sun,  are  almost  as  16,  81,  and  -       ~o^~~       — >  or  156609:  and  therefore 
the  difference  of  the  forces  of  gravity  of  the  sun  towards  Saturn,  and  of 
Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  towards  the 
sun  as  65  to  156609,  or  as  1  to  2409.  But  the  greatest  power  of  Saturn 
to  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and 
therefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of 
Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that 
the  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon.  The  common 
centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth  and  moon  moves  in  an  ellipsis  about  the  sun 
in  the  focus  thereof,  and,  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun,  describes  areas  pro 
portional  to  the  times  of  description.  But  the  earth  in  the  mean  time  by

the  said  common  laws  of  attraction.  Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies 
to  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance 
from  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop.  XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it 
would  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in 
.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in 
a  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as 
that  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, 
Jupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon 
together  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing 
happens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts 
(p.  75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose.  To  hinder  such  a 
descent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required.  And  hence  depends  the 
force  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the 
planets.  Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of 
their  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de 
scend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded 
by  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the 
former  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths 
would  descend  to  the  sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, 
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor 
become  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are 
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to 
revolve  in  their  orbits,  are  
apparent  geocentric  motion,  we  infer  (by  Prop.  Ill 
Cor.  IV)  that  the  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  turned  out  of  a  rectilinear  course, 
and  made  to  revolve  in  an  orb,  is  not  directed  to  the  centre  of  the  earth. 
And  the  same  argument  holds  good  in  Mars  and  in  Saturn.  Another  centre 
of  these  forces  is  therefore  to  be  looked  for  (by  Prop.  II  and  III,  and  the 
Corollaries  of  the  latter),  about  which  the  areas  described  by  radii  inter 
vening  may  be  equable ;  and  that  this  is  the  sun,  we  have  proved  already 
in  Mars  and  Saturn  nearly,  but  accurately  enough  in  Jupiter.  It  may  be 
alledged  that  the  sun  and  planets  are  impelled  by  some  other  force  equally 
and  in  the  direction  of  parallel  lines ;  but  by  such  a  force  (by  Cor.  VI  of 
the  Laws  of  Motion)  no  change  would  happen  in  the  situation  of  the 
planets  one  to  another,  nor  any  sensible  eifect  follow  :  but  our  business  is 
with  the  causes  of  sensible  effects.  Let  us,  therefore,  neglect  every  such 
force  as  imaginary  and  precarious,  and  of  no  use  in  the  phenomena  of  the 
heavens ;  and  the  whole  remaining  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  impelled  will 
be  directed  (by  Prop.  Ill,  Cor.  I)  to  the  centre  of  the  sun. 
The  distances  of  the  planets  from  the  sun  come  out  the  same,  whether, 
with  Tycho,  we  place  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  system,  or  the  sun  with 
Copernicus  :  and  we  have  already  proved  that  these  distances  are  true  ir.

But  I  should  be  glad  the  diameters  of  the  planets  were  more  accurately 
measured  ;  and  that  may  be  done,  if  a  lamp,  set  at  a  great  distance,  is  made 
to  shine  through  a  circular  hole,  and  both  the  hole  and  the  light  of  the 
lamp  are  so  diminished  that  the  spectrum  may  appear  through  the  telescope 
just  like  the  planet,  and  may  be  defined  by  the  same  measure :  then  the 
diameter  of  the  hole  will  be  to  its  distance  from  the  objective  glass  as  the 
true  diameter  of  the  planet  to  its  distance  from  us.  The  light  of  the  lamp 
may  be  diminished  by  the  interposition  either  of  pieces  of  cloth,  or  of 
smoked  glass. 
Of  kin  to  the  analogy  we  have  been  describing,  there  is  another  observed 
between  the  forces  and  the  bodies  attracted  (p.  395,  396,  397).  Since  the 
action  of  the  centripetal  force  upon  the  planets  decreases  in  the  duplicate 
proportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- 
cate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and 
therefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis 
tances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total 
actions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for 
if  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could 
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal 
times :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it 
was  not  that  the  circum-solar  force  was  equally  exerted  upon  Jupiter  and 
all  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights.  And  the  same  thing 
is  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in

 by  math 
ematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments.  By  the  first 
two  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de 
scent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo 
tion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing 
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re 
sistance  of  the  air.  When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its 
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces 
upon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole 
time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional 
to  the  time.  And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the 
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the 
times.  And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im 
presses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the 
times  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken 
off,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, 
the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities.  And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain 
ing  and  harmonizing  the  many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica 
ble  phenomena. 
Guided  by  the  genius  of  Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound  to

The  principle  of  Universal  Gravi'  ition,  namely,  that  every

particle  of  matter,  icith  a  force  inversely  proportional  to  the 
squares  of  their  distances — is  the  discovery  w?  ich  characterizes 
The  PRINCIPIA.  This  principle  the  author  deduced  from  the  mo 
tion  of  the  moon,  and  the  three  laws  of  Kepler — laws,  which 
Newton,  in  turn,  by  his  greater  law,  demonstrated  to  be  true. 
From  the  first  law  of  Kepler,  namely,  the   proportionality  of

force  is  not  directed  from  P  to  T  ;  and,  secondly,  because  it  is  not  recipro 
cally  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  distance  PT.  These  things  being 
premised,  it  is  manifest  that  the  areas  are  then  most  nearly  proportional  to 
the  times,  when  that  third  force  is  the  least  possible,  the  rest  preserving 
their  former  quantity  ;  and  that  the  orbit  PAB  does  then  approach  nearest 
to  the  elliptical  figure  above-mentioned,  when  both  the  second  and  third, 
but  especially  the  third  force,  is  the  least  possible;  the  first  force  remain 
ing  in  its  former  quantity. 
Let  the  accelerative  attraction  of  the  body  T  towards  S  be  expressed  by 
the  line  SN  ;  then  if  the  accelerative  attractions  SM  and  SN  were  equal, 
these,  attracting  the  bodies  T  and  P  equally  and  in  parallel  directions 
would  not  at  all  change  their  situation  with  respect  to  each  other.  The  mo 
tions  of  the  bodies  between  themselves  would  be  the  same  in  that  case  as  if 
those  attractions  did  not  act  at  all,  by  Cor.  6,  of  the  Laws  of  Motion.  And, 
by  a  like  reasoning,  if  the  attraction  SN  is  less  than  the  attraction  SM,  it 
will  take  away  out  of  the  attraction  SM  the  part  SN,  so  that  there  will  re 
main  only  the  part  (of  the  attraction)  MN  to  disturb  the  proportionality  of 
the  areas  and  times,  and  the  elliptical  figure  of  the  orbit.  And  in  like 
manner  if  the  attraction  SN  be  greater  than  the  attraction  SM,  the  pertur 
bation  of  the  orbit  and  proportion  will  be  produced  by  the  difference  MN 
alone.  After  this  manner  the  attraction  SN  reduces  always  the  attraction

His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven 
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor 
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes 
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his 
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New 
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug 
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669. 
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ; 
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis 
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science, 
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name. 
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method 
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities 
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation ;  among  the 
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria ;  among  the 
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis. 
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la- 
hours  of  his  predecessors :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved 
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented 
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this 
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination 
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their 
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing 
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as 
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor 
tion  of  the  length  of  the  ordinate,  and  supposing  the  abscissa 
to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines

more  or  less  diminution  ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba 
ble  :  and,  in  order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of  diminution 
might  be,  he  considered  that  if  the  moon  be  retained  in  her  orbit 
by  the  force  of  gravity,  the  primary  planets  must  also  be  carried 
round  the  sun  by  the  like  power;  and,  by  comparing  the  periods 
of  the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun,  he  found 
that,  if  they  were  held  in  their  courses  by  any  power  like  gravity, 
its  strength  must  decrease  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  in 
crease  of  distance.  In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the 
planets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun.  Now 
was  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?  Was  such  a  force,  em 
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to  the  moon,  sufficient,  when 
diminished  as  the  square  of  the  distance,  to  retain  her  in  her 
orbit  ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he  compared  the  space 
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall,  in  a  second  of  time,  at  a  given 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  namely,  at  its  surface,  with 
the  space  through  which  the  moon  falls,  as  it  were,  to  the  earth, 
in  the  same  time,  while  revolving  in  a  circular  orbit.  He  was 
absent  from  books  ;  and,  therefore,  adopted,  in  computing  the 
earth's  diameter,  the  common  estimate  of  sixty  miles  to  a  degree 
of  latitude  as  then  in  use  among  geographers  and  navigators. 
The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex 
pectations  ;  hence,  he  concluded  that  some  other  cause,  beyond  the 
reach  of  observation — analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des 
cartes — joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the

a  transcendant  mind.  Marble  and  brass  dissolve  and  pass  away  ; 
but  the  true  creations  of  genius  endure,  in  time  and  beyond  time, 
forever  :  high  upon  the  adamant  of  the  indestructible,  they  send 
forth  afar  and  near,  over  the  troublous  waters  of  life,  a  pure,  un 
wavering,  quenchless  light  whereby  the  myriad  myriads  of  barques, 
richly  laden  with  reason,  intelligence  and  various  faculty,  are 
guided  through  the  night  and  the  storm,  by  the  beetling  shore 
and  the  hidden  rock,  the  breaker  and  the  shoal,  safely  into  havens 
calm  and  secure. 
To  the  teacher  and  the  taught,  the  scholar  and  the  student,  the 
devotee  of  Science  and  the  worshipper  of  Truth,  the  PRINCIPIA 
must  ever  continue  to  be  of  inestimable  value.  If  to  educate 
means,  not  so  much  to  store  the  memory  with  symbols  and  facts, 
as  to  bring  forth  the  faculties  of  the  soul  and  develope  them  to  the 
full  by  healthy  nurture  and  a  hardy  discipline,  then,  what  so  effec 
tive  to  the  accomplishment  of  that  end  as  the  study  of  Geometri 
cal  Synthesis  ?  The  Calculus,  in  some  shape  or  other,  is,  indeed, 
necessary  to  the  successful  prosecution  of  researches  in  the  higher 
branches  of  philosophy.  But  has  not  the  Analytical  encroached 
upon  the  Synthetical,  and  Algorithmic  Formulae  been  employed 
when  not  requisite,  either  for  the  evolution  of  truth,  or  even  its 
apter  illustration  ?  To  each  method  belongs,  undoubtedly,  an 
appropriate  use.  Newton,  himself  the  inventor  of  Fluxions, 
censured  the  handling  of  Geometrical  subjects  by  Algebraical 
calculations  ;  and  the  maturest  opinions  which  he  expressed  were 
additionally  in  favour  of  the  Geometrical  Method.  His  prefer 
ence,  so  st
 book  was  sent  to  the  Society,  and  presented  on  the 
2d  March  ;  the  third,  on  the  6th  April ;  and  the  whole  was  com 
pleted  and  published  in  the  month  of  May,  1686-7.  In  the  sec 
ond  Lemma  of  the  second  book,  the  fundamental  principle  of  his 
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for  the  first  time,  given  to  the  world ;  but 
its  algorithm  or  notation  did  not  appear  till  published  in  the 
second  volume  nf  Dr.  Wallis's  works,  in  1693. 
And  thus  was  ushered  into  existence  The  PRINCIPIA — a  work 
to  which  pre-eminence  above  all  the  productions  of  the  human 
intellect  has  been  awarded — a  work  that  must  be  esteemed  of 
priceless  worth  so  long  as  Science  has  a  votary,  or  a  single  wor 
shipper  be  left  to  kneel  at  the  altar  of  Truth.
NING  THE  FORM  OF  THE  MOST  ANCIENT 
^EAR,  closes  this  enumeration  of  his  Chronological  Writings. 
A  ihird  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  appeared  in  1726,  with  many 
changes  and  additions.  About  four  years  were  consumed  in  its 
preparation  and  publication,  which  were  under  the  superintend- 
ance  of  Dr.  Henry  Pemberton,  an  accomplished  mathematician, 
and  the  author  of  "A  VIEW  OF  SIR  ISAAC  NEWTON'S  PHILO 
SOPHY."  1728.  This  gentleman  enjoyed  numerous  opportunities 
of  conversing  with  the  aged  and  illustrious  author.  "  I  found," 
says  Pemberton,  "  he  had  read  fewer  of  the  modern  mathemati 
cians  than  one  could  have  expected;  but  his  own  prodigious 
invention  readily  supplied  him  with  what  he  might  have  an  occa 
sion  for  in  the  pursuit  of  any  subject  he  undertook.  I  have  often

and  to  teach,  and  so  render  himself,  not  the  "ornament"  cnly; 
but  inconceivably  more,  the  pre-eminent  benefactor  of  his  species. 
The  honour  of  knighthood  v/as  conferred  on  our  author  in 
1705.  Soon  afterward,  he  was  a  candidate  again  for  the  Repre 
sentation  of  the  University,  but  was  defeated  by  a  large  majority. 
It  is  thought  that  a  more  pliant  man  was  preferred  by  both  min 
isters  and  electors.  Newton  was  always  remarkable  for  simplicity 
of  dress,  and  his  only  known  departure  from  it  was  on  this  oc 
casion,  when  he  is  said  to  have  appeared  in  a  suit  of  laced 
clothes. 
The  Algebraical  Lectures  which  he  had,  Juring  nine  years, 
delivered  at  Cambridge,  were  published  by  Whiston,  in  1707, 
under  the  title  of  ARITHMETICS  UNIVERSALIS,  SINE  DE  COMPOSI 
TIONS  ET  RESOLUTIONS  ARITHMETICA  LIBER.  This  publication 
is  said  to  have  been  a  breach  of  confidence  on  Whiston's  part.  Mr. 
Ralphson,  not  long  afterward,  translated  the  work  into  English ; 
and  a  second  edition  of  it,  with  improvements  by  the  author,  was 
issued  at  London,  1712,  by  Dr.  Machin.  Subsequent  editions, 
both  in  English  and  Latin,  with  commentaries,  have  been  published. 
In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a 
second  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro 
fessor  of  Astronomy  at  Cambridge.  The  first  edition  had  been 
sold  off  for  some  time.  Copies  of  the  work  had  become  very 
rare,  and  could  only  be  obtained  at  several  times  their  original 
cost.  A  great  number  of  letters  passed  oetween  the  author  and 
Mr.  Cotes  during  the  preparation  of  the  edition,  which  finally 
appeared  in  May,  1713.  It  had  many  alterations  and  improve 
ments,  and  was  accompanied  by  an  admirable  Preface  from  the

better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted.

The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed

His  early  and  fast  friend,  Dr.  Barrow — in  compass  of  inven 
tion  only  inferior  to  Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor 
of  Greek  in  the  University,  in  1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes 
sor  of  Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his 
Optical  Lectures  :  the  manuscripts  of  these  were  revised  by  New 
ton,  and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug 
gestions  made  by  him  ;  but  they  were  not  published  till  1669. 
In  the  year  1665,  he  received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts ; 
and,  in  1666,  he  entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis 
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science, 
and  immortality  upon  his  own  name. 
Newton,  himself,  states  that  he  was  in  possession  of  his  Method 
of  Fluxions,  "  in  the  year  1666,  or  before."  Infinite  quantities 
had  long  been  a  subject  of  profound  investigation ;  among  the 
ancients  by  Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of  Alexandria ;  among  the 
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis. 
With  consummate  ability  Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la- 
hours  of  his  predecessors :  with  a  higher  power,  Newton  moved 
forwards  from  where  Wallis  stopped.  Our  author  first  invented 
his  celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this 
Theorem  to  the  rectification  of  curves,  and  to  the  determination 
of  the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids,  and  the  position  of  their 
centres  of  gravity,  he  discovered  the  general  principle  of  deducing 
the  areas  of  curves  from  the  ordinate,  by  considering  the  area  as 
a  nascent  quantity,  increasing  by  continual  fluxion  in  the  propor 
tion  of  the  length  of  the  ordinate,  and  supposing  the  abscissa 
to  increase  uniformly  in  proportion  to  the  time.  Regarding  lines

"  I.  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  in  London  in  the  beginning  of  the  year 
1673  ;  and  went  thence  in  or  about  March,  to  Paris,  where  he 
kept  a  correspondence  with  Mr.  Collins,  by  means  of  Mr.  Olden 
burg,  till  about  September,  1676,  and  then  returned,  by  London 
and  Amsterdam,  to  Hanover:  and  that  Mr.  Collins  was  very  free 
in  communicating  to  able  mathematicians  what  he  had  received 
from  Mr,  Newton  and  Mr.  Gregory. 
"  II.  That  when  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  the  first  time  in  London, 
he  contended  for  the  invention  of  another  differential  method, 
properly  so  called  ;  and,  notwithstanding  he  was  shown  by  Dr. 
Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to 
be  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself 
without  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much 
improved  it.  And  we  find  no  mention  of  his  having  any  other 
differential  method  than  Newton's  before  his  letter  of  the  21st  of 
June,  1677,  which  was  a  year  after  a  copy  of  Mr.  Newton's  letter 
of  the  10th  of  December,  1672,  had  been  sent  to  Paris  to  be 
communicated  to  him ;  and  above  four  years  after  Mr.  Collins 
began  to  communicate  that  letter  to  his  correspondents  ;  in  which 
letter  the  method  of  fluxions  was  sufficiently  described  to  any 
intelligent  person. 
"III.  That  by  Mr.  Newton's  letter,  of  the  13th  of  June,  1676 
it  appears  that  he  had  the  method  of  fluxions  above  five  years 
before  the  writing  of  that  letter.  And  by  his  Analysis  per  ^Equa- 
tiones  numero  Terminorum  Infmitas,  communicated  by  Dr.  Barrow 
to  Mr.  Collins,  in  July,  1669,  we  find  that  he  had  invented  the 
method  before  that  time. 
"IV.  That  the  differential  method  is  one  and  the  same  with 
the  method  of  fluxions, 
se  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they 
bear  to  sensible  objects.  And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re 
moving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute 
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common. 
I.  Absolute,  true,  and  mathematical  time,  of  itself,  and  from  its  own  na 
ture  flows  equably  without  regard  to  anything  external,  and  by  another 
name  is  called  duration  :  relative,  apparent,  and  common  time,  is  some  sen 
sible  and  external  (whether  accurate  or  unequable)  measure  of  duration  by 
the  means  of  motion,  which  is  commonly  used  instead  of  true  time ;  such 
as  an  hour,  a  day,  a  month,  a  year. 
II.  Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter 
nal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is  some  mo 
vable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de 
termine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo 
vable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial 
space,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.     Absolute  and 
relative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re 
main  always  numerically  the  same.     For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, 
a  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al 
ways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which
OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.  79 
tions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of 
absolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change.  The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the 
existence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, 
or  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are 
only  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means 
of  the  astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter 
mining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments 
of  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter. 
As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of 
the  parts  of  space.  Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and 
they  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. 
For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of 
all  other  things.  All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; 
and  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation.  It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature 
that  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be 
moveable,  is  absurd.  These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans 
lations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions. 
But  because  the  parts  of  space  cannot  be  seen,  or  distinguished  from  one 
another  by  our  senses,  therefore  in  their  stead  we  use  sensible  measures  of 
them.  For  from  the  positions  and  distances  of  things  from  any  body  con 
sidered  as  immovable,  we  define  all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such 
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some 
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absol
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, 
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is 
really  at  rest,  the  body,  which  relatively  rests  in  the  ship,  will  really  and 
absolutely  move  with  the  same  velocity  which  the  ship  has  on  the  earth. 
But  if  the  earth  also  moves,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  the  body  will 
arise,  partly  from  the  true  motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space ;  partly 
from  the  relative  motion  of  the  ship  on  the  earth ;  and  if  the  body  moves 
also  relatively  in  the  ship ;  its  true  motion  will  arise,  partly  from  the  true 
motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space,  and  partly  from  the  relative  mo 
tions  as  well  of  the  ship  on  the  earth,  as  of  the  body  in  the  ship  ;  and  from 
these  relative  motions  will  arise  the  relative  motion  of  the  body  on  the 
earth.     As  if  that  part  of  the  earth,  where  the  ship  is,  was  truly  moved 
toward  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10010  parts;  while  the  ship  itself,  with 
a  fresh  gale,  and  full  sails,  is  carried  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  ex 
pressed  by  10  of  those  parts  ;  but  a  sailor  walks  in  the  ship  towards  the 
east,  with  1  part  of  the  said  velocity ;  then  the  sailor  will  be  moved  truly 
in  immovable  space  towards  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10001  parts,  and 
relatively  on  the  earth  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  of  9  of  those  parts. 
Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa 
tion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time.  For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un 
equal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas 
ure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate 
deducing  of  the  celestial  motion
able  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. 
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the 
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no 
means  consist  in  such  relations. 
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the

absolutely  understood,  it  will  be  perpetually  mutable. 
III.  Place  is  a  part  of  space  which  a  body  takes  up,  and  is  according  to 
the  space,  either  absolute  or  relative.   I  say,  a  part  of  space ;  not  the  situation, 
nor  the  external  surface  of  the  body.     For  the  places  of  equal  solids  are 
always  equal ;  but  their  superfices,  by  reason  of  their  dissimilar  figures,  are 
often  unequal.     Positions  properly  have  no  quantity,  nor  are  they  so  much 
the  places  themselves,  as  the  properties  of  places.     The  motion  of  the  whole 
is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  the  parts ;  that  is,  the 
translation  of  the  whole,  out  of  its  place,  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum 
of  the  translations  of  the  parts  out  of  their  places ;  and  therefore  the  place 
of  the  whole  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  places  of  the  parts,  and 
for  that  reason,  it  is  internal,  and  in  the  whole  body. 
IV.  Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute 
place  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative 
place  into  another.     Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body 
is  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity 
which  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : 
and  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the 
ship,  or  of  its  cavity.     But  real,  absolute  rest,  is  the  continuance  of  the 
body  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, 
its  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved.     Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is 
really  at  rest,  th
all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such 
places,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some 
of  those  places  into  others.  And'so,  instead  of  absolute  places  and  motions, 
we  use  relative  ones;  and  that  without  any  inconvenience  in  common  af 
fairs  ;  but  in  philosophical  disquisitions,  we  ought  to  abstract  from  our 
senses,  and  consider  things  themselves,  distinct  from  what  are  only  sensible 
measures  of  them.  For  it  may  be  that  there  is  no  body  really  at  rest,  to 
which  the  places  and  motions  of  others  may  be  referred. 
But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from 
the  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It  is  a  property  of  rest, 
that  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another.  And  therefore 
as  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps 
far  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi 
ble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions 
whether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it 
follows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies 
in  our  regions. 
It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions 
to  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes.  For  all  the 
parts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; 
and  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus 
of  all  the  parts.  Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that 
are  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion.  Upon 
which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-

the  areas  to  t\ie  times  of  their  description,  our  author  inferred 
that  the  force  which  retained  the  planet  in  its  orbit  was  always 
directed  to  the  sun ;  and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every 
planet  moves  in  an  ellipse  with  the  sun  in  one  of  its  foci,  he  drew 
the  more  general  inference  that  the  force  by  which  the  planet 
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as  the  square  of  its  dis 
tance  therefrom  :  and  he  demonstrated  that  a  planet  acted  upon 
by  such  a  force  could  not  move  in  any  other  curve  than  a  conic 
section ;  showing  when  the  moving  body  would  describe  a  circu 
lar,  an  elliptical,  a  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  orbit.  He  demon 
strated,  too,  that  this  force,  or  attracting,  gravitating  power  re 
sided  in  every,  the  least  particle ;  but  that,  in  spherical  masses,  it 
operated  as  if  confined  to  their  centres ;  so  that,  one  sphere  or 
body  will  act  upon  another  sphere  or  body,  with  a  force  directly 
proportional  to  the  quantity  of  matter,  and  inversely  as  the  square 
of  the  distance  between  their  centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of 
mutual  approach  will  be  in  the  inverse  ratio  of  their  quantities  o*' 
matter.  Thus  he  grandly  outlined  the  Universal  Law.  Verify 
ing  its  truth  by  the  motions  of  terrestrial  bodies,  then  by  those  of 
the  moon  and  other  secondary  orbs,  he  finally  embraced,  in  one 
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System — all  the  move 
ments  of  all  its  bodies — planets,  satellites  and  comets — explain

or  change  the  velocity  of  the  body  in  that  path,  but  only  draw  it  aside 
from  a  rectilinear  course,  and  make  it  deflect  perpetually  from  the  tangent 
of  the  orbit,  and  proceed  in  the  curvilinear  path  ITK/j.  That  whole 
force,  therefore,  will  be  spent  in  producing  this  effect:  but  the  other  force

  is  gravity,  by  which  bodies  tend  to  the  centre  of  the  earth 
magnetism,  by  which  iron  tends  to  the  loadstone ;  and  that  force,  what 
ever  it  is,  by  which  the  planets  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from  the  rec 
tilinear  motions,  which  otherwise  they  would  pursue,  and  made  to  revolve 
in  curvilinear  orbits.  A  stone,  whirled  about  in  a  sling,  endeavours  to  re 
cede  from  the  hand  that  turns  it ;  and  by  that  endeavour,  distends  the 
sling,  and  that  with  so  much  the  greater  force,  as  it  is  revolved  with  the 
greater  velocity,  and  as  soon  as  ever  it  is  let  go,  flies  away.  That  force 
which  opposes  itself  to  this  endeavour,  and  by  which  the  sling  perpetually 
draws  back  the  stone  towards  the  hand,  and  retains  it  in  its  orbit,  because 
it  is  directed  to  the  hand  as  the  centre  of  the  orbit,  I  call  the  centripetal 
force.  And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in 
any  orbits.  They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; 
and  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them 
to,  and  detains  them  in  their  orbits,  which  I  therefore  call  centripetal,  would 
tiy  off  in  right  lines,  with  an  uniform  motion.  A  projectile,  if  it  was  not 
for  the  force  of  gravity,  would  not  deviate  towards  the  earth,  tut  would

the  centre  of  force  in  the  same  manner  as  another  body  in  the  same 
trajectory  at  rest. 
In.  the  orbit  VPK,  given  by  position,  let  the  body 
P  revolve,   proceeding  from   V  towards  K.     From 
the  centre  C  let  there  be  continually  drawn  Cp,  equal 
to  CP,  making  the  angle  VC/?  proportional  to  the 
angle  VCP ;  and  the  area  which  the  line  Cp  describes 
will  be  to  the  area  VCP,  which  the  line  CP  describes 
at  the  same  time,  ns  the  velocity  of  the  describing 
line  Cp  to  the  velocity  of  the  describing  line  CP ; 
that  is,  as  the  angle  VC/?  to  the  angle  VCP,  therefore  in  a  given  ratio, 
and  therefore  proportional  to  the  time.     Since,  then,  the  area  described  by 
the  line  Cp  in  an  immovable  plane  is  proportional  to  the  time,  it  is  manifest 
that  a  body,  being  acted  upon  by  a  just  quantity  of  centripetal  force  may

may  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known 
force,  such  as  that  of  gravity.  For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re 
volves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal 
force  of  that  body.  But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one 
entire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given 
(by  Cor.  9  of  this  Prop.).  And  by  such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in  his 
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of 
gravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies. 
The  preceding  Proposition  may  be  likewise  demonstrated  after  this 
manner.  In  any  circle  suppose  a  polygon  to  be  inscribed  of  any  number 
of  sides.  And  if  a  body,  moved  with  a  given  velocity  along  the  sides  of  the 
polygon,  is  reflected  from  the  circle  at  the  several  angular  points,  the  force, 
with  which  at  every  reflection  it  strikes  the  circle,  will  be  as  its  velocity  : 
and  therefore  the  sum  of  the  forces,  in  a  given  time,  will  be  as  that  ve 
locity  and  the  number  of  reflections  conjunctly ;  that  is  (if  the  species  of 
the  polygon  be  given),  as  the  length  described  in  that  given  time,  and  in 
creased  or  diminished  in  the  ratio  of  the  same  length  to  the  radius  of  the 
circle ;  that  is,  as  the  square  of  that  length  applied  to  the  radius ;  and 
therefore  the  polygon,  by  having  its  sides  diminished  in'inftnitum,  coin 
cides  with  the  circle,  as  the  square  of  the  arc  described  in  a  given  time  ap 
plied  to  the  radius.  This  is  the  centrifugal  force,  with  which  the  body 
impels  the  circle ;  and  to  which  the  contrary  force,  wherewith  the  circle 
continually  repels  the  body  towards  the  centre,
er  by  the  force  of  gravity,  if  it 
is  endued  with  gravity,  or  by  any  other  force,  that  impels  it  towards  the 
earth,  may  be  perpetually  drawn  aside  towards  the  earth,  out  of  the  r&ti- 
linear  way,  which  by  its  innate  force  it  would  pursue;  and  would  be  made 
to  revolve  in  the  orbit  which  it  now  describes ;  nor  could  the  moon  with 
out  some  such  force,  be  retained  in  its  orbit.  If  this  force  was  too  small, 
it  would  not  sufficiently  turn  the  moon  out  of  a  rectilinear  course :  if  it 
was  too  great,  it  would  turn  it  too  much,  arid  draw  down  the  moon  from 
its  orbit  towards  the  earth.  It  is  necessary,  that  the  force  be  of  a  just 
quantity,  and  it  belongs  to  the  mathematicians  to  find  the  force,  that  may 
serve  exactly  to  retain  a  body  in  a  given  orbit,  with  a  given  velocity ;  and 
vice  versa,  to  determine  the  curvilinear  way,  into  which  a  body  projected 
from  a  given  place,  with  a  given  velocity,  may  be  made  to  deviate  from 
its  natural  rectilinear  way,  by  means  of  a  given  force. 
The  quantity  of  any  centripetal  force  may  be  considered  as  of  three 
kinds;  aboolu'e,  accelerative,  and  motive. 
DEFINITION  VI. 
The  absolute  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure  f>f  the  same 
proportional  to  the  efficacy  of  the  cause  that  propagates  it  from  the  cen 
tre,  through  the  spaces  round  about. 
Thus  the  magnetic  force  is  greater  in  one  load-stone  and  less  in  another 
according  to  their  sizes  and  strength  of  intensity.
is  most  certain  that  these  effects  must  proceed 
from  the  action  of  some  force  or  other. 
But  our  purpose  is  only  to  trace  out  the  quantity  and  properties  of  this 
force  from  the  phenomena  (p.  218),  and  to  apply  what  we  discover  in  some 
simple  cases  as  principles,  by  which,  in  a  mathematical  way,  we  may  esti 
mate  the  effects  thereof  in  more  involved  cases :  for  it  would  be  endless  and 
impossible  to  bring  every  particular  to  direct  and  immediate  observation. 
We  said,  in  a  mathematical  way,  to  avoid  all  questions  about  the  na 
ture  or  quality  of  this  force,  which  we  would  not  be  understood  to  deter 
mine  by  any  hypothesis;  and  therefore  call  it  by  the  general  name  of  a 
centripetal  force,  as  it  is  a  force  which  is  directed  towards  some  centre ; 
and  as  it  regards  more  particularly  a  body  in  that  centre,  we  call  it  circum 
solar,  circum-terrestrial,  circum-jovial ;  and  in  like  manner  in  respect  of 
other  central  bodies. 
That  by  means  of  centripetal  forces  the  planets  may  be  retained  in  cer 
tain  orbits,  we  may  easily  understand,  if  we  consider  the  motions  of  pro 
jectiles  (p.  75,  76,  77) ;  for  a  stone  projected  is  by  the  pressure  of  its  own 
weight  forced  out  of  the  rectilinear  path,  which  by  the  projection  alone  it 
should  have  pursued,  and  made  to  describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ;  and 
through  that  crooked  way  is  at  last  brought  down  to  the  ground ;  and  the 
greater  the  velocity  is  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  farther  it  goes  before 
it  falls  to  the  earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to  be  so  in
h 
this  force  acts  mast  either  descend  directly  to  that  centre,  or  at  least  devi 
ate  perpetually  towards  it  from  right  lines,  if  otherwise  they  should  have 
moved  obliquely  in  these  right  lines. 
And  how  from  the  motions  given  we  may  infer  the  forces,  or  from  the 
forces  given  we  may  determine  the  motions,  is  shewn  in  the  two  first  Books 
of  our  Principles  of  Philosophy. 
If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved 
in  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which 
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but 
to  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, 
which  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, 
describe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht 
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. 
Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor.  Ill,  Prop.  IV,  Book  1), 
it  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, 
and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs.  And  the  like 
consequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the 
planets. 
That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de 
pend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an 
hypothesis  too  incongruous.  It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces 
should  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for

so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a 
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won 
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies." 
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be 
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred 
years  before  this  memorable  birth. 
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com 
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with 
small  one  which  she  possessed  at  Sewstern,  in  Leicestershire,  yield 
ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum, 
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa 
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years, 
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care 
of  her  own  mother. 
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; 
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at 
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. 
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- 
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary. 
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con 
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no 
charms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the 
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem 
ingly  dull  student  gave  him  a  severe  
60  LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON. 
years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled ;  and,  in 
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}' 
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity. 
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state 
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most 
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal 
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu 
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean 
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the 
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid, 
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably 
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was 
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge. 
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who 
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose. 
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand 
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces 
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve 
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern 
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father 
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable 
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the 
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit ;  and  the  other, 
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit, 
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con 
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he 
had  dischar

chiefly,  in  the  possession  of  the  family  of  the  Earl  of  Portsmouth, 
through  the  Viscountess  Lymington. 
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che 
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are 
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the 
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  Edinburgh. 
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke 
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in 
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: — " 'Tis  built  of  stone, 
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good 
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-, 
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger 
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University. 
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of 
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down 
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr 
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir 
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple- 
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned 
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed 
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved 
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with 
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white 
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the 
follow, ng  inscription  : —

turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed

of  discovery — the  stirring  elements  of  that  wondrous  spirit, 
which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through 
deep  onward  through  deep  of  Nature's  mysteries,  unlocking  her 
strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere  si 
lently  conquering. 
Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures, 
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn, 
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He 
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making 
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated, 
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early 
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She 
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe ;  but 
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham. 
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same 
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per 
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the 
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed, 
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune 
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar 
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated 
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and 
kindness. 
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took 
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen 
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, 
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him 
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage 
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When

It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* 
tarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings 
The  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, 
of  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his 
works  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every 
thing  like  contest  or  dispute.  But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver 
sion,  we  find,  underlying  his  whole  character  and  running  parallel 
with  all  his  discoveries,  that  extraordinary  humility  which  always 
preserved  him  in  a  position  so  relatively  just  to  the  behests  of 
time  and  eternity,  that  the  infinite  value  of  truth,  and  the  utter 
worthlessness  of  fame,  were  alike  constantly  present  to  him. 
Judging  of  his  course,  however,  in  its  more  temporary  aspect,  as 
bearing  upon  his  immediate  quiet,  it  seemed  the  most  unfortunate. 
For  an  early  publication,  especially  in  the  case  of  his  Method  of 
Fluxions,  would  have  anticipated  all  rivalry,  and  secured  him 
from  the  contentious  claims  of  Leibnitz.  Still  each  one  will  solve 
the  problem  of  his  existence  in  his  own  way,  and,  with  a  manlike 
Newton,  his  own,  as  we  conceive,  could  be  no  other  than  the  best 
way.  The  conduct  of  Leibnitz  in  this  affair  is  quite  irreconcilable 
with  the  stature  and  strength  of  the  man ;  giant-like,  and  doing 
nobly,  in  many  ways,  a  giant's  work,  yet  cringing  himself  into  the 
dimensions  and  performances  of  a  common  calumniator.  Opening 
in  1699,  the  discussion  in  question  continued  till  the  close  of 
Leibnitz's  life,  in  1716.  We  give  the  summary  of  the  case  as

FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling 
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control 
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din 
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and 
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and 
moral  truth ;  ascending  height  after  height ;  sweeping  afar  over 
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en 
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly 
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose, 
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its 
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous 
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo 
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis 
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect 
God. 
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain, 
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De 
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the 
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New 
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his 
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi 
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the 
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and 
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness, 
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise 
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life

so  doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ; — lived  to  a  vigorous  maturity,  to  a 
hale  old  age  ; — lived  to  become  the  boast  of  his  country,  the  won 
der  of  his  time,  and  the  "ornament  of  his  srjecies." 
Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir 
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be  traced.  Two  traditions  were  held 
in  the  family :  one,  that  they  were  of  Scotch  extraction  ;  the 
other,  that  they  came  originally  from  Newton,  in  Lancashire, 
dwelling,  for  a  time,  however,  at  Westby,  county  of  Lincoln,  be 
fore  the  removal  to  and  purchase  of  Woolsthorpe — about  a  hundred 
years  before  this  memorable  birth. 
The  widow  Newton  was  left  with  the  simple  means  of  a  com 
fortable  subsistence.     The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with

ed  her  an  income  of  some  eighty  pounds ;  and  upon  this  limited  sum, 
she  had  to  rely  chiefly  for  the  support  of  herself,  and  the  educa 
tion  of  her  child.     She   continued  his  nurture  for  three  years, 
when,  marrying  again,  she  confided  the  tender  charge  to  the  care 
of  her  own  mother. 
Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; 
and  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at 
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. 
In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- 
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary. 
But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con 
tinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no 
charms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the 
school.  One  day,  however,  the  boy  immediately  above  our  seem

years,  ind  full  of  honours,  the  heaven-sent  was  recalled ;  and,  in 
the  confidence  of  a  "  certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}' 
into  the  silent  depths  of  Eternity. 
His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state 
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most 
distinguished.  In  1731,  his  relatives,  the  inheritors  of  his  personal 
estate,  erected  a  monument  to  his  memory  in  the  most  conspicu 
ous  part  of  the  Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by  the  dean 
and  chapter  to  the  greatest  of  England's  nobility.  During  the 
same  year  a  medal  was  struck  at  the  Tower  in  his  honour  ;  arid, 
in  1755,  a  full-length  statue  of  him,  in  white  marble,  admirably 
executed,  by  Roubiliac,  at  the  expense  of  Dr.  Robert  Smith,  was 
erected  in  the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge. 
There  is  a  painting  executed  in  the  glass  of  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  same  college,  made  pursuant  to  the  will  of  Dr.  Smith,  who 
left  five  hundred  pounds  for  that  purpose. 
Newton  left  a  personal  estate  of  about  thirty-two  thousand 
pounds.  It  was  divided  among  his  four  nephews  and  four  nieces 
of  the  half  blood,  the  grand-children  of  his  mother,  by  the  Reve 
rend  Mr.  Smith.  The  family  estates  of  Woolsthorpe  arid  Sustern 
fell  to  John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father 
was  Sir  Isaac's  uncle.  Before  his  death  he  made  an  equitable 
distribution  of  his  two  other  estates :  the  one  in  Berkshire  to  the 
sons  and  daughter  of  a  brother  of  Mrs.  Conduit ;  and  the  other, 
at  Kensington,  to  Catharine,  the  only  daughter  of  Mr.  Conduit, 
and  who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con 
duit  succeeded  to  the  offices  of  the  Mint,  the  duties  of  which  he

chiefly,  in  the  possession  of  the  family  of  the  Earl  of  Portsmouth, 
through  the  Viscountess  Lymington. 
Everything  appertaining  to  Newton  has  been  kept  and  che 
rished  with  peculiar  veneration.  Different  memorials  of  him  are 
preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ;  in  the  rooms  of  the 
Royal  Society,  of  London  :  and  in  the  Museum  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  Edinburgh. 
The  manor-house,  at  Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by  Dr.  Stuke 
ley,  in  October,  1721,  who,  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Mead,  written  in 
1727,  gave  the  following  description  of  it: — " 'Tis  built  of  stone, 
as  is  the  way  of  the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good 
one.  They  led  me  up  stairs  and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-, 
where  I  supposed  he  studied,  when  in  the  country,  in  his  younger 
days,  or  perhaps  when  he  visited  his  mother  from  the  University. 
I  observed  the  shelves  were  of  his  own  making,  being  pieces  of 
deal  boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his  books  and  clothes  down 
in  on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago,  two  or  threr 
hundred  books  in  it  of  his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir 
Isaac  gave  to  Dr.  Newton,  of  our  town."  The  celebrated  apple- 
tree,  the  fall  of  one  of  the  apples  of  which  is  said  to  have  turned 
the  attention  of  Newton  to  the  subject  of  gravity,  was  destroyed 
by  the  wind  about  twenty  years  ago ;  but  it  has  been  preserved 
in  the  form  of  a  chair.  The  house  itself  has  been  protected  with 
religious  care.  It  was  repaired  in  1798,  and  a  tablet  of  white 
marble  put  up  in  the  room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the 
follow, ng  inscription  : —

which,  clear,  calm,  and  great,  moved,  in  after  years,  through

strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere  si

Newton  had  an  early  and  decided  taste  for  drawing.  Pictures, 
taken  sometimes  from  copies,  but  often  from  life,  and  drawn, 
coloured  and  framed  by  himself,  ornamented  his  apartment.  He 
was  skilled  also,  in  poetical  composition,  "  excelled  in  making 
verses  ;"  some  of  these  were  borne  in  remembrance  and  repeated, 
seventy  years  afterward,  by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for  whom,  in  early 
youth,  as  Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She 
was  the  sister  of  a  physician  resident  near  Woolsthorpe ;  but 
Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at  Grantham. 
where  they  were  both  numbered  among  the  inmates  of  the  same 
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of  great  per 
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent,  her  society  afforded  him  the 
greatest  pleasure  ;  and  their  youthful  friendship,  it  is  believed, 
gradually  rose  to  a  higher  passion ;  but  inadequacy  of  fortune 
prevented  their  union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar 
ried  ;  Newton,  never;  his  esteem  for  her  continued  unabated 
during  life,  accompanied  by  numerous  acts  of  attention  and 
kindness. 
In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took 
up  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now  fifteen 
years  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, 
desirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him 
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage 
ment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.  When

FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the  middle  ages  man's  struggling 
spirit  emerged  as  in  new  birth  ;  breaking  out  of  the  iron  control 
of  that  period  ;  growing  strong  and  confident  in  the  tug  and  din 
of  succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it  bounded  forwards  and 
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to  the  investigation  of  physical  and 
moral  truth ;  ascending  height  after  height ;  sweeping  afar  over 
the  earth,  penetrating  afar  up  into  the  heavens  ;  increasing  in  en 
deavour,  enlarging  in  endowment ;  every  where  boldly,  earnestly 
out-stretching,  till,  in  the  AUTHOR  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose, 
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of  the  universe  and  treading  its 
celestial  paths,  opened  up  to  the  human  intellect  the  stupendous 
realities  of  the  material  world,  and,  in  the  unrolling  of  its  harmo 
nies,  gave  to  the  human  heart  a  new  song  to  the  goodness,  wis 
dom,  and  majesty  of  the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect 
God. 
Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  whom  the  rising  intellect  seemed  to  attain, 
as  it  were,  to  its  culminating  point,  was  born  on  the  25th  of  De 
cember,  O.  S.  1642 — Christmas  day — at  Woolsthorpe,  in  the 
parish  of  Colsterworth,  in  Lincolnshire.  His  father,  John  New 
ton,  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-six,  and  only  a  few  months  after  his 
marriage  to  Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of  James  Ayscough,  oi 
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the 
early  loss  of  her  husband,  gave  premature  birth  to  her  only  and 
posthumous  child,  of  which,  too,  from  its  extreme  diminutiveness, 
she  appeared  likely  to  be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it  was  otherwise 
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on  whose  little  lips  the  breath  of  life
LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON,  13 
turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no 
better  attention.  In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more 
absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in 
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the 
advantages  which  an  education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back 
to  Grantham  school,  where  he  remained  for  some  months  in  busy 
preparation  for  his  academical  studies.  At  the  recommendation 
of  one  of  his  uncles,  who  had  himself  studied  at  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither,  and  was  duly  admitted. 
on  the  5th  day  of  June  1660,  in  the  eighteenth  year  of  his  age. 
The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a  new  and  wider 
field ;  and  we  find  him  devoting  himself  to  the  pursuit  of  know 
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and  perseverance.  Among  other  sub 
jects,  his  attention  was  soon  drawn  to  that  of  Judicial  Astrology 
He  exposed  the  folly  of  this  pseudo-science  by  erecting  a  figure 
with  the  aid  of  one  or  two  of  the  problems  of  Euclid  ; — and  thus 
began  his  study  of  the  Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this 
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success. 
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in  Euclid  as  self-evident 
truths,  he  passed  rapidly  over  this  ancient  system — a  step  which 
he  afterward  much  regretted — and  mastered,  without  further  pre 
paratory  study,  the  Analytical  Geometry  of  Descartes.  Wallis's 
Arithmetic  of  Infinites,  Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of 
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ;  writing  upon  them 
many  comments ;  and,  in  these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un 
doubtedly  the  germ  of  his  fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was 
so  great  that  he  found  himself  more  profoundly  versed

77w?  quantity  of  matter  is  the  measure  of  the  same,  arising  from  its 
density  and  hulk  conjutictly. 
THUS  air  of  a  double  density,  in  a  double  space,  is  quadruple  in  quan- 
ti  ty ;  in  a  triple  space,  sextuple  in  quantity.  The  same  thing  is  to  be  un 
derstood  of  snow,  and  fine  dust  or  powders,  that  are  condensed  by  compres 
sion  or  liquefaction  •  and  of  all  bodies  that  are  by  any  causes  whatever 
differently  condensed.  I  have  no  regard  in  this  place  to  a  medium,  if  any 
such  there  is,  that  freely  pervades  the  interstices  between  the  parts  oi 
bodies.  It  is  this  quantity  that  I  mean  hereafter  everywhere  under  the 
name  of  body  or  mass.  And  the  same  is  known  by  the  weight  of  each 
body ;  for  it  is  proportional  to  the  weight,  as  I  have  found  by  experiments 
on  pendulums,  very  accurately  made,  which  shall  be  shewn  hereafter.

The  quantity  of  motion  is  the  measure  nf  tlie  same,  arising  from  the 
velocity  and  quantity  of  matter  corjunctly. 
The  motion  of  the  whole  i<!  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  all  the  parts ;  and 
therefore  in  a  body  double  in  quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the  motion  is 
iouble ;  with  twice  the  velocity,  it  is  quadruple, 
DEFINITION  III. 
The  vis  insita,  or  innate  force  of  matter,  is  a  power  of  resisting,  hy 
which  every  body,  as  much  as  in  it  lies,  endeavours  to  persevere  in  its 
present  stale,  whether  it  be  of  rest,  or  of  moving  uniformly  forward 
in  a  right  line. 
This  force  is  ever  proportional  to  the  body  whose  force  it  is ;  and  differs 
nothing  from  the  inactivity  of  the  mass,  but  in  our  manner  of  conceiving
76  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES 
DEFINITION  VII. 
The  accelerative  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force  is  the  measure,  of  tht 
same,  proportional  to  the  velocity  which  it  generates  in  a  given  time. 
Thus  the  force  of  the  same  load-stone  is  greater  at  a  less  distance,  and 
less  at  a  greater :  also  the  force  of  gravity  is  greater  in  valleys,  less  on 
tops  of  exceeding  high  mountains ;  and  yet  less  (as  shall  hereafter  be  shown), 
at  greater  distances  from  the  body  of  the  earth ;  but  at  equal  distan 
ces,  it  is  the  same  everywhere ;  because  (taking  away,  or  allowing  for,  the 
resistance  of  the  air),  it  equally  accelerates  all  falling  bodies,  whether  heavy 
or  light,  great  or  small. 
DEFINITION  VIII. 
TJie  motive  quantity  of  a  centripetal  force,  is  the  measure  of  the  samt\ 
proportional  to  the  motion  which  it  generates  in  a  given  twip. 
Thus  the  weight  is  greater  in  a  greater  body,  less  in  a  less  body ;  and. 
in  the  same  body,  it  is  greater  near  to  the  earth,  and  less  at  remoter  dis 
tances.  This  sort  of  quantity  is  the  centripetency,  or  propension  of  the 
whole  body  towards  the  centre,  or,  as  I  may  say,  its  weight ;  and  it  is  al 
ways  known  by  the  quantity  of  an  equal  and  contrary  force  just  sufficient 
to  Ifinder  the  descent  of  the  body. 
These  quantities  of  forces,  we  may,  for  brevity's  sake,  call  by  the  names 
of  motive,  accelerative,  and  absolute  forces ;  and,  for  distinction's  sake,  con 
sider  them,  with  respect  to  the  bodies  that  tend  to  the  centre ;  to  the  places 
of  those  bodies ;  and  to  the  centre  of  force  towards  which  they  tend  ;  that 
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen 
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the 
sever
able  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do 
all  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account 
must  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. 
The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one 
from  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. 
True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed 
upon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered 
without  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body.  For  it  is  sufficient  only  to 
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, 
that  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re 
lative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist.  Again,  true  motion 
suffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving 
body  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such 
forces.  For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, 
with  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre 
served,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion 
consists.  And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the 
true  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the 
true  suffers  some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by  no 
means  consist  in  such  relations. 
The  effects  whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc,  the 
forces  of  receding  from  the  axis  of  circular  motion.  For  there  are  no  such 
forces  in  a  circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in  a  true  and  absolute  cir 
cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less,  according  t »  the  quantity  of  the
y  tend  ;  that 
is  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen 
sity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the 
several  parts  taken  together ;  the  accelerative  force  to  the  place  of  the 
body,  as  a  certain  power  or  energy  diffused  from  the  centre  to  all  places 
around  to  move  the  bodies  that  are  in  them :  and  the  absolute  force  to 
the  centre,  as  endued  with  some  cause,  without  which  those  motive  forces 
would  not  be  propagated  through  the  spaces  round  about ;  whether  that 
cause  be  some  central  body  (siuh  as  is  the  load-stone,  in  the  centre  of  the 
magnetic  force,  or  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  gravitating  force),  or 
anything  else  that  does  not  yet  appear.  For  I  here  design  only  to  give  a 
mathematical  notion  of  those  forces,  without  considering  their  physical 
causes  and  seats. 
Wherefore  the  accelerative  force  will  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  the 
motive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion.  For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from 
the  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises 
from  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter.  For 
the  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles 
of  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole.  Hence  it  is,  that  near  the

because  the  force  with  which  the  weight  p  presses  the  plane  pQi  is  to  the 
force  with  which  the  same,  whether  by  its  own  gravity,  or  by  the  blow  of 
a  mallet,  is  impelled  in  the  direction  of  the  line  joH  towards  both  the 
planes,  as  joN  to  pH ;  and  to  the  force  with  which  it  presses  the  other 
plane  pG,  as  joN  to  NH.  And  thus  the  force  of  the  screw  may  be  deduced 
from  a  like  resolution  of  forces ;  it  being  no  other  than  a  wedge  impelled 
with  the  force  of  a  lever.  Therefore  the  use  of  this  Corollary  spreads  far 
and  wide,  and  by  that  diffusive  extent  the  truth  thereof  is  farther  con 
firmed.  For  on  what  has  been  said  depends  the  whole  doctrine  of  mechan 
ics  variously  demonstrated  by  different  authors.  For  from  hence  are  easily 
deduced  the  forces  of  machines,  which  are  compounded  of  wheels,  pullics, 
levers,  cords,  and  weights,  ascending  directly  or  obliquely,  and  other  mechan 
ical  powers ;  as  also  the  force  of  the  tendons  to  move  the  bones  of  animals. 
COROLLARY  III. 
The  (/uaittity  of  motion,  which  is  collected  by  taking  the  sum  of  the  mo 
tions  directed  towards  the  same  parts,  and  the  difference  of  those  that 
are  directed  to  contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the  action  oj 
bodies  among  themselves. 
For  action  and  its  opposite  re-action  are  equal,  by  Law  III,  and  there 
fore,  by  Law  II,  they  produce  in  the  motions  equal  changes  towards  oppo 
site  parts.  Therefore  if  the  motions  are  directed  towards  the  same  parts. 
whatever  is  added  to  the  motion  of  the  preceding  body  will  be  subducted 
from  the  motion  of  that  which  follows  ;  so  that  the  sum  will  be  the  same 
as  before.  If  the  bodies  meet,  with  contrary  motions,  there  will  be  an 
equal  deduction

LAW  I. 
Hvery  body  perseveres  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  uniform  motion  in  a  ri^ht 
line,  unless  it  is  compelled  to  change  that  state  by  forces  impressed 
thereon.

A  top,  whose  parts  by  their  cohesion  are  perpetually  drawn  aside  from 
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its  rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it  is  re 
tarded  by  the  air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  meeting 
with  less  resistance  in  more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro 
gressive  and  circular  for  a  much  longer  time. 
LAW   II. 
The  alteration  of  motion  is  ever  proportional  to  the  motive  force  imp  reus 
ed  ;  and  is  made  in  the  direction  of  the  right  line  in.  which  that  force 
is  impressed. 
If  any  force  generates  a  motion,  a  double  force  will  generate  double  the 
motion,  a  triple  force  triple  the  motion,  whether  that  force  be  impressed 
altogether  and  at  once,  or  gradually  and  successively.  And  this  motion 
(being  always  directed  the  same  way  with  the  generating  force),  if  the  body 
moved  before,  is  added  to  or  subducted  from  the  former  motion,  according 
as  they  directly  conspire  with  or  are  directly  contrary  to  each  other ;  or 
obliquely  joined,  when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to  produce  a  new  motion 
compounded  from  the  determination  of  both. 
LAW  III. 
To  every  action  there  is  always  opposed  an  equal  reaction :  or  the  mu 
tual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal,  and  di 
rected  to  contrary  parts. 
Whatever  draws  or  presses  another  is  as  much  drawn  or  pressed  by  that 
other.  If  you  press  a  stone 
roblem ;  7 
move  a  given  weight  with  a  given  power,  or  with  a  given  force  to  over 
come  any  other  given  resistance.  For  if  machines  are  so  contrived  that  the 
velocities  of  the  agent  and  resistant  are  reciprocally  as  their  forces,  the 
agent  will  just  sustain  the  resistant,  but  with  a  greater  disparity  of  ve 
locity  will  overcome  it.  So  that  if  the  disparity  of  velocities  is  so  great 
as  to  overcome  all  that  resistance  which  commonly  arises  either  from  the 
attrition  of  contiguous  bodies  as  they  slide  by  one  another,  or  from  the 
cohesion  of  continuous  bodies  that  are  to  be  separated,  or  from  the  weights 
of  bodies  to  be  raised,  the  excess  of  the  force  remaining,  after  all  those  re 
sistances  are  overcome,  will  produce  an  acceleration  of  motion  proportional 
thereto,  as  well  in  the  parts  of  {he  machine  as  in  the  resisting  body.  But 
to  treat  of  mechanics  is  not  my  present  business.  I  was  only  willing  to 
show  by  those  examples  the  great  extent  and  certainty  of  the  third  Law  ot 
motion.  For  if  we  estimate  the  action  of  the  agent  from  its  force  and 
velocity  conjunctly,  and  likewise  the  reaction  of  the  impediment  conjuncth 
from  the  velocities  of  its  several  parts,  and  from  the  forces  of  resistance 
arising  from  the  attrition,  cohesion,  weight,  and  acceleration  of  those  parts, 
the  action  and  reaction  'YL  the  use  of  all  sorts  of  machines  will  b"  found 
always  equal  to  one  another.  And  so  far  as  the  action  is  propagated  by 
the  intervening  instruments,  and  at  last  impressed  upon  tic  resisting 
body,  the  ultimate  determination  of  the  action  will  be  always  contrary  to 
the  determination  of  the  reaction.
