Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Quantity of motion is defined as the product of the quantity of matter (mass) and celerity (velocity) of a body. It is distinct from force in that quantity of motion measures the motion itself, while force refers to the action that changes or generates motion. Motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter, whereas quantity of motion arises from velocity multiplied by the quantity of matter.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as a planet and the Sun, are equal and opposite.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravitational force experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. A central force produces zero torque about the center, so angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This directly leads to Kepler's Second Law.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing the motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow the same law: their centripetal forces are inversely proportional to the squares of their distances from the center. Thus, the total gravitational force between two masses is the sum of the forces from all their parts, each following the inverse square law.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, all planets towards each other, and comets towards the sun. This mutual gravitation is proportional to the matter in each body and acts between every particle of matter. The force of gravity between two bodies is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Therefore, all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation, and gravity acts universally on all masses.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities or disturbances in the motion of each planet. The superposition of these gravitational influences alters the orbital path, resulting in observable perturbations.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he admired the taste and form of ancient geometric demonstration, preferred their style, and regretted not following them more closely. He also had a repugnance to contest or dispute, which contributed to his reluctance to publish his purely mathematical writings and adopt new notations.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved, orbital trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the medium and the square of the velocity. He distinguishes between different types of resistance—arising from the inactivity of the fluid, tenacity of its parts, or friction. In sufficiently fluid media like air, water, or mercury, resistance is mainly due to density and velocity squared. He also notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones of equal density. Newton analyzes how resistance affects motion, provides methods to determine the density of the medium for a given motion, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the true, immovable framework within which all motion occurs, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of external factors. Relative motion, in contrast, is measured only with respect to other objects and does not reveal true motion. Newton's laws, especially the first law (inertia) and second law (F=ma), require absolute space and time to define true acceleration and force, distinguishing real motion from mere relative motion between bodies.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's paternal grandfather was Robert Newton, and his maternal grandfather was James Ayscough.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage.

Q1. When will my root canal claim of Rs 25,000 be settled?
A1. Your root canal claim of Rs 25,000 will be settled or rejected within 15 days from the date of receipt of the last necessary document by the Company. If the Company requires an investigation, the claim will be settled or rejected within 45 days from the date of receipt of the last necessary document. In case of delay beyond these periods, the Company is liable to pay interest at a rate 2% above the bank rate from the date of receipt of the last necessary document to the date of payment.

Q2. I have done an IVF for Rs 56,000. Is it covered?
A2. No, expenses related to IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) are not covered under this policy. Expenses related to sterility and infertility, including IVF, ZIFT, GIFT, ICSI, and gestational surrogacy, are specifically excluded.

Q3. I did a cataract treatment of Rs 100,000. Will you settle the full Rs 100,000?
A3. No, only up to 25% of the Sum Insured or Rs 40,000 per eye, whichever is lower, will be settled for cataract treatment in one policy period. The full Rs 100,000 will not be settled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?
A1. Expenses would NOT be covered if the treatment involves non-medical items such as ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer/thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home except when they form part of room expenses. Additionally, expenses are not covered if the treatment is received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments, or if the provider is specifically excluded by the insurer. Treatment for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, or any addictive condition and their consequences is also not covered.

Q2. A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?
A2. Payable items:
- Prosthetic device implanted during hip replacement surgery

Not payable:
- Walker (not payable)
- Lumbar belt (payable only for cases who have undergone surgery of lumbar spine, not hip replacement)

Therefore, only the prosthetic device is payable. The walker and lumbar belt are not payable.

Q3. An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A3. The insured's child, being above 18 but under 26, unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, is eligible for coverage. Dental surgery expenses are admissible if the treatment is for reconstruction following an accident, as exclusions for cosmetic or plastic surgery do not apply in this case. For claim processing, the insured must submit the claim form, invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports, all duly signed, to the insurer's branch or head office. The insurer will assess the documents and settle or reject the claim within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document. If the dental surgery is for accident-related reconstruction, the claim is admissible.

Q4. If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A4. Expenses for Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period for claims involving IONM, subject to the overall restriction that 12 modern treatments as per IRDAI (including IONM) are limited to 50% of the Sum Insured.

ICU charges, including ICU bed, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges, are covered up to 4% of the Sum Insured per day (inclusive of nursing charges), as specified in the policy. If the insured is admitted to a higher category than entitled, the insured will bear the difference in all medical expenses in the same proportion as the final hospital bill.

Both expenses are subject to the actual expenses incurred or the specified policy limits, whichever is less.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. To add a newly-adopted 3-year-old child as a dependent, the policyholder must submit an application for cover. The insurer will assess the application, and if accepted, the child will be added as an Insured Person during the policy period, provided the additional pro-rata premium for the coverage duration is paid and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued.

The insurer may refuse cover if:
- The application for cover is not accepted by the insurer.
- The required additional premium is not received.
- The policyholder fails to notify the insurer of the change within the stipulated time (on or before the last day of the succeeding month).
- The child does not meet the eligibility criteria as specified in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance.
- The minimum group size requirement is not maintained.

All additions are subject to underwriter assessment, and additional information or documents may be requested. Coverage is effective from the date of request or premium payment, whichever is later.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. For the day care cataract procedure:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior to admission in case of planned hospitalisation.
- If using the cashless facility, submit documents immediately after discharge.
- If claiming reimbursement, submit all required documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

For the subsequent 5-day inpatient care in a non-network hospital:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior to admission in case of planned hospitalisation.
- Since it is a non-network hospital, claim will be on a reimbursement basis.
- Submit all required documents for reimbursement within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

For both claims, ensure all relevant information is provided, including plan of treatment and policy number, as per the process defined. If claiming post-hospitalisation expenses, submit documents within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment.

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. The newborn’s treatment expenses are eligible for claim only if:

- The policyholder has opted for maternity cover.
- The newborn is accepted as an insured person, which requires written notification to the insurer on or before the last day of the month following the birth and payment of the agreed premium.

Definitions specify a "New Born Baby" as a baby born during the policy period and aged up to 90 days. The policy allows coverage for newborns from birth, subject to the above notification and premium conditions.

However, if the newborn was not notified and the premium not paid before the death, the newborn’s treatment expenses are not eligible for claim.

Exclusions do not bar coverage for newborn intensive care if the above conditions are met.

Summary:
- If written notification and premium payment for the newborn were completed as required, the newborn’s intensive care expenses are eligible for claim.
- If notification and premium were not completed before the newborn’s death, the claim for the newborn’s treatment expenses is not eligible.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient. The required documents for an inpatient psychiatric treatment claim include a certificate regarding diagnosis and treatment from an attending medical practitioner or surgeon, who must hold valid registration from the Medical Council of India or a State Medical Council. A general practitioner’s prescription alone does not establish psychiatric diagnosis or treatment, and a discharge summary certified only by a Clinical Psychologist is not valid, as a Clinical Psychologist is not recognized as a “Medical Practitioner” under the policy definitions. The discharge summary and diagnosis must be certified by a registered medical practitioner (psychiatrist or physician with appropriate registration). Therefore, both the prescription and discharge summary must be from a qualified and registered medical practitioner, not solely from a Clinical Psychologist.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. ECG electrodes are admissible up to 5 electrodes for every case visiting OT or ICU; for longer ICU stays, at least one set every second day is payable. Gloves are not listed as payable items and are therefore not admissible for reimbursement.

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Pre-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred 18 days before admission for the same illness can be claimed, provided they fall within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is accepted.

Post-hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge for the same illness can be claimed, provided they are within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is accepted.

Both pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses must relate to the same illness or injury for which hospitalisation was required, and claims are subject to the policy’s specified time limits and amount limits.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period, their coverage as a dependent ceases when they are no longer eligible (i.e., upon turning 27). Coverage does not continue until the end of the policy period. The child must be deleted from the policy effective from the date they cease to be a dependent, regardless of the premium having been paid for the full year. Refund of premium for the remaining period may be made on a pro-rata basis, provided no claim is paid or outstanding for that dependent.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. Associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, are reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rent per day bears to the actual room rent per day. This is as per the Proportionate Clause, which applies when the insured opts for a room with a rate exceeding the policy limit and differential billing is followed.

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation and the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, the company may have already sent up to three reminders and may have settled or deducted the deficient amount if the claim was otherwise valid. If the company then issues a final rejection, it must communicate the grounds for rejection in writing within 15 days from receipt of the final documents or investigation report.

The insured person has 15 days from receipt of the rejection decision to represent to the company for reconsideration. If the claim is not the subject of any pending suit or proceeding and is not pursued within twelve months from the date of rejection or partial settlement, the claim is deemed abandoned and the company’s liability is extinguished.

If there is a delay in claim payment beyond the stipulated period (15 days from receipt of last necessary document, or 45 days if investigation is required), the company must pay interest at 2% above the bank rate from the date of receipt of last necessary document to the date of payment. 

For grievance redressal, the insured may follow the company’s grievance procedure as outlined in the policy.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the "Day Care Treatment" category.

Requirements:
- The procedure is undertaken under General Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement.
- The procedure would have otherwise required hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.
- Treatment normally taken on an out-patient basis is not covered.

Since the insured person was hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia, which previously required more than 24 hours, the claim meets the requirements for Day Care Treatment.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. In a town with less than 1 million population, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. In metropolitan areas (towns with a population of 1 million or more), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. The difference is the minimum number of in-patient beds required: 10 for smaller towns, 15 for larger towns or metropolitan areas.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A16. Eligibility criteria:

- New employee: Must be an employee of the policyholder (employer-employee relationship).
- Spouse: Must be the employee’s legal spouse or life partner (including live-in partner).
- Sibling: Must be the employee’s sibling, unmarried/unemployed, dependent, and up to 26 years of age.

Documentation and process required:

- Application for cover for each person.
- Additional premium on a pro-rata basis for the coverage duration.
- Endorsement request in writing by the policyholder.
- Any additional information/documents as requested by the underwriter.
- For sibling: Proof of relationship, age, dependency, and unmarried/unemployed status.
- For spouse: Proof of marriage or partnership.
- For employee: Proof of employment and joining date.

Coverage is effective from the date of joining or date of premium payment, whichever is later, after acceptance and issuance of endorsement.

Q17. Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A17. Robotic surgery for cancer is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, whether performed as a day care procedure or as inpatient hospitalization. For claims involving malignancies (cancer), the same sub-limit applies in both scenarios. Additionally, for modern treatments as per IRDAI, including robotic surgery for cancer, coverage is restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. For air ambulance evacuation following an accident with subsequent inpatient admission, the following steps and requirements must be followed:

Pre-Authorization:
- Notify the insurer or TPA at the call centre or in writing within 10 days from the date of the accident.
- Submit a pre-authorization request to the insurer/TPA with all relevant medical details.
- The TPA will check with the Network Provider whether pre-authorization has been utilized and if all dues are settled.
- If admitted to a PPN hospital, submit the duly filled and signed PPN declaration format available with the hospital.
- If relevant medical details are not provided, pre-authorization may be denied, but treatment can proceed and claims can be submitted for reimbursement.

Claims Assessment:
- Settle all non-admissible expenses, expenses above specified sub-limits, co-payments, and/or opted deductibles directly with the hospital.
- For reimbursement, submit all necessary documents to the TPA within the prescribed time limit.
- Claims for pre- and post-hospitalisation will be settled on a reimbursement basis upon production of cash receipts and supporting documents.
- The pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation claims will be processed only after the main hospitalisation claim is decided.

Mandatory Requirements and Documentation:
- Timely notification of the accident and claim (within 10 days).
- Submission of pre-authorization request with complete medical details.
- Duly filled and signed PPN declaration format (if admitted to a PPN hospital).
- Settlement of non-admissible expenses directly with the hospital.
- Submission of all required claim documents and cash receipts for reimbursement within the prescribed time limit.
- Production of supporting documents for pre- and post-hospitalisation claims.

Required documents: All documents mentioned in the Base Cover claim reimbursement process, plus any additional documents specified for air ambulance and hospitalisation, cash receipts, and supporting medical documents.

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If the insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer and recently ported to this policy, the waiting period for a specific illness (such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) will be reduced by the period of continuous coverage under the previous policy, as per IRDAI portability guidelines. The insured will get accrued continuity benefits in waiting periods, provided there is no break in coverage. However, if there is an enhancement of the Sum Insured, the waiting period will apply afresh to the increased amount.

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. The expense will not be covered if the imported medication is considered experimental or unproven in medical practice in India. For coverage, the treatment must be medically necessary, prescribed by a medical practitioner, and conform to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India. If the medication does not meet these criteria, it is excluded from coverage.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. For a non-employer group policy, if a member dies during the policy period, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period, at the option of the insured, as specified in the Policy Schedule.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the required supporting documentation includes the original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries (e.g., stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery). If only a generic invoice is provided without the implant sticker, the claim may be rejected or delayed, as the implant sticker is a mandatory document to verify the specific device used.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement if:

- The insured person was hospitalised due to the accident during the policy period.
- The insurance company has accepted the inpatient hospitalisation claim for that accident.
- The home nursing is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to provide expert nursing services immediately after discharge.
- The post-hospitalisation medical expenses, including home nursing, are for the same condition as the hospitalisation.
- The expenses are incurred within the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Required documentation:

- Proof of hospitalisation and discharge summary.
- Accepted inpatient hospitalisation claim.
- Written confirmation from the treating Medical Practitioner that home nursing is medically required.
- Details of the Qualified Nurse (valid registration from the Nursing Council of India or State Nursing Council).
- Bills and receipts for home nursing services.
- Any other documents specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. If the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer will seek details of other available policies of the policyholder and coordinate with other Insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided a written request for the same has been submitted by the Insured Person. If original documents have been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified documents listed under clause VI.5.1 and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer, subject to the company's satisfaction.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. If the insured's hospitalization was solely for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, with no treatment provided, these expenses are not claimable. Diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment are also excluded. Therefore, such hospitalization expenses are not admissible under the policy.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. If there is no prior endorsement for nominee change and the previous nominee has passed away, the insurer will pay the claim amount to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. Their discharge will be treated as full and final settlement of the insurer’s liability under the policy.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered in the following scenarios, even if associated with hospitalization:

- When they are not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the insured person was hospitalized.
- When used for diagnosis and treatment but are ambulatory devices or equipment subsequently used at home, such as walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer, thermometer, and any medical equipment used at home except when they form part of room expenses.
- When they are not medically necessary or not part of the recuperation process on a short-term basis.
- When they are for cosmetic or plastic surgery or any treatment to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk, certified by the attending medical practitioner.
- When they are not prescribed by a registered medical practitioner as part of a hospitalization claim or day care procedure.
- When they are for external congenital anomaly or defects.
- When they are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment.
- When they are not of a reasonable charge or not a medically necessary treatment.

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. Expenses will not be reimbursed because the AYUSH hospital must be registered with local authorities to be eligible for claims. Registration is a mandatory criterion, regardless of the presence of qualified practitioners.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. The network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the TPA for the revised diagnosis, treatment plan, or increased cost during hospitalization, following the prescribed process. This ensures continued cashless eligibility.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. The pre-hospitalisation medical expenses claim will be processed only after the main hospitalisation claim has been decided. If submitted before approval of the main inpatient hospitalisation claim, it will not be processed until the main claim decision is made.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A31. Answer not present in documents.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Claims cannot be approved automatically. All claims must follow the defined process, including submission of required documents, medical examination if requested, cooperation in investigation, and assessment of claim validity and quantum. Automatic approval is not permitted under the stated procedures.

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. If a claim has missing documents, the deficiency will be intimated to the Insured Person, and up to three reminders will be sent. If the deficiency is not rectified within the specified time, the insurer may deduct the amount related to the deficiency and settle the rest of the claim if otherwise valid.

If a claim is supported by forged or fraudulent documents, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid will be forfeited. Any amount already paid on such claims must be repaid by all recipients, who are jointly and severally liable. The insurer will not repudiate the claim or forfeit benefits on the ground of fraud if the Insured Person can prove the misstatement was unintentional and not deliberate.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. No, you cannot receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization. Only expenses related to the same illness or injury for which in-patient hospitalization was accepted are covered, and unrelated or incidental diagnostic expenses are excluded.

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide include:

- Treatment in any hospital or by any Medical Practitioner or provider specifically excluded by the Insurer and disclosed on its website/notified to policyholders (except in life-threatening situations or following an accident, only up to stabilization stage).
- Treatment for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, or any addictive condition and consequences thereof.
- Treatments received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments, or private beds registered as a nursing home.
- Cosmetic or plastic surgery or any treatment to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, or cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk to the insured (must be certified by the attending Medical Practitioner).
- Treatment related to hazardous or adventure sports.
- Costs of donor screening or costs incurred in an organ transplant surgery involving organs not harvested from a human body.
- Any form of alternative treatment.
- Treatments not supported by a prescription.

Q36. How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A36. I cannot assist with illegal or unethical requests. Submitting fraudulent claims is illegal and unethical.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Quantity of motion is defined as the product of the quantity of matter (mass) and celerity (velocity) of a body. It is distinct from force in that quantity of motion measures the motion itself, while force refers to the action that changes or tends to change the motion. Motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter, whereas quantity of motion arises from velocity multiplied by the quantity of matter.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as a planet and the Sun, are equal and opposite.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravitational force experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. A central force produces zero torque about the center, so angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This directly leads to Kepler's Second Law.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. For two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing that the centripetal forces required to keep moons or planets in orbit follow the same inverse square law, as seen in the periodic times of their orbits. Thus, the total gravitational force between two masses is the sum of the forces from all their parts, each following the inverse square law, resulting in the overall force being inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, all planets towards each other, and comets towards the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This universal gravitation applies to every particle of matter, meaning all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these gravitational influences results in complex, non-Keplerian motion, known as orbital perturbations.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he admired the taste and form of ancient geometric demonstration, preferred their style, and regretted not following them more closely. He also had a repugnance to contest or dispute, which contributed to his reluctance to publish his purely mathematical writings and adopt new notations.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the medium and the square of the velocity. He distinguishes between different types of resistance—arising from the inactivity of the fluid, tenacity of its parts, or friction. In sufficiently fluid media like air, water, and certain oils, resistance is mainly due to density and velocity squared. He also notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones of equal density. Newton provides methods to determine the density of the medium and the resistance encountered by a body moving along a given path, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging framework. Absolute space is the immovable stage where all motion occurs, and absolute time flows uniformly regardless of events. Relative motion, in contrast, describes movement only in relation to other objects, not to this fixed background. Newton's laws, especially the first law (inertia), rely on absolute space and time to define true motion and rest, distinguishing them from merely relative changes in position. This framework ensures that forces and accelerations are measured objectively, supporting the universality and consistency of his laws of motion.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's paternal grandfather was Robert Newton, and his maternal grandfather was James Ayscough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?
A1. Expenses would NOT be covered if the treatment involves non-medical items such as ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer/thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home except when they form part of room expenses. Additionally, expenses incurred towards treatment by any Medical Practitioner or provider specifically excluded by the insurer, or treatments received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments, are not covered. Treatment for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, or any addictive condition and consequences thereof is also not covered.

Q2. A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?
A2. Payable items:
- Prosthetic device implanted during hip replacement surgery

Not payable:
- Walker (not payable)
- Lumbar belt (payable only for cases who have undergone surgery of lumbar spine, not hip replacement)

Q3. An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A3. The insured's child, being above 18 but under 26, unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, is eligible for coverage. Dental surgery expenses are admissible if the treatment is for reconstruction following an accident, as exclusions for cosmetic or plastic surgery do not apply in this case. 

Claim process:
- Submit the claim form along with invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports, all duly signed by the insured person, to the insurer's branch or head office.
- The insurer will assess the claim documents and determine admissibility.
- The claim will be settled or rejected within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document.

If the dental surgery is reconstructive and medically necessary due to the accident, the claim is admissible following the above process.

Q4. If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A4. Processing timed out for this question.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. To add a newly-adopted 3-year-old child as a dependent, the policyholder must submit an application for cover. The insurer will assess the application, and if accepted, the child will be added as an Insured Person during the policy period, provided the additional pro-rata premium for the coverage duration is paid and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued.

The insurer may refuse cover if:
- The application for cover is not accepted by the insurer.
- The required additional premium is not received.
- The policyholder fails to notify the insurer of the change within the stipulated time (on or before the last day of the succeeding month).
- The relationship is not recognized as eligible under the policy schedule or certificate of insurance.
- The minimum group size requirement is not met.
- Any required additional information or documents requested by the underwriter are not provided.

Eligibility for dependents includes children up to age 26 if unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The adopted child, being 3 years old, meets the age criterion.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. For the day care cataract procedure:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior to admission in case of planned hospitalisation.
- If using the cashless facility, submit documents immediately after discharge.
- If claiming reimbursement, submit all required documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

For the subsequent inpatient hospitalisation due to complications in a non-network hospital:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior to admission in case of planned hospitalisation.
- Since it is a non-network hospital, claim will be on a reimbursement basis.
- Submit all required documents for reimbursement within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

Required documents for both claims include all relevant information relating to the claim such as plan of treatment, policy number, and any other documents as per the process defined under Clause VI.3 and VI.4. For post-hospitalisation expenses, submit documents within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment.

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. The newborn’s treatment expenses are eligible for claim only if:

- Maternity cover is opted.
- The newborn is accepted as an insured person, which requires written notification to the insurer on or before the last day of the month following the birth and payment of the agreed premium.

However, as per the policy:

- Medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) are covered, except for ectopic pregnancy.
- Newborn babies are covered from birth, subject to the limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, if the above notification and premium conditions are met.
- The newborn is defined as a baby born during the policy period and aged up to 90 days.

If the newborn was not notified and premium not paid before the death, the claim for the newborn’s intensive care expenses is not eligible. If notification and premium payment were completed as required, the newborn’s intensive care expenses are eligible for claim under the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, subject to policy limits and exclusions.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient. The required documents for an inpatient psychiatric treatment claim include a certificate regarding diagnosis and treatment from an attending medical practitioner or surgeon, who must hold valid registration from the Medical Council of India or a State Medical Council. A general practitioner’s prescription alone does not establish psychiatric diagnosis or treatment, and a discharge summary certified only by a Clinical Psychologist is not valid, as a Clinical Psychologist is not recognized as a “Medical Practitioner” under the policy definitions. The discharge summary and diagnosis must be certified by a registered medical practitioner (psychiatrist or physician with appropriate registration). All other required documents, such as medical history, bills, and payment receipts, must also be included and supported by prescriptions from the attending medical practitioner/hospital.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. ECG electrodes are admissible up to 5 electrodes for every case visiting OT or ICU; for longer ICU stays, at least one set every second day is payable. Gloves are not listed as payable items and are therefore not admissible for reimbursement.

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Pre-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred 18 days before admission for the same illness can be claimed, provided they fall within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is accepted.

Post-hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge for the same illness can be claimed, provided they are within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is accepted.

Both pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses must relate to the same illness or injury for which hospitalisation was required, and claims are subject to the policy’s specified time limits and amount limits.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period, their coverage as a dependent ceases when they are no longer eligible (i.e., upon turning 27). Coverage does not continue until the end of the policy period. The child must be deleted from the policy effective from the date they cease to be a dependent, regardless of the premium having been paid for the full year. Refund of premium for the remaining period may be made on a pro-rata basis, provided no claim is paid or outstanding for that dependent.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. Associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, are reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rent per day bears to the actual room rent per day. This is as per the Proportionate Clause, which applies when the insured opts for a room with a rate exceeding the policy limit and differential billing is followed.

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation and the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, the company may have already sent up to three reminders and may have settled or deducted the deficient amount if the claim was otherwise valid. If the company then issues a final rejection, it must communicate the grounds for rejection in writing within 15 days from receipt of the final documents or investigation report.

The insured person has 15 days from receipt of the rejection decision to represent to the company for reconsideration. If the claim is not the subject of any pending suit or proceeding and is not pursued within twelve months from the date of rejection or partial settlement, the claim is deemed abandoned and the company’s liability is extinguished.

If there is a delay in claim payment beyond the stipulated period (15 days from receipt of last necessary document, or 45 days if investigation is required), the company must pay interest at 2% above the bank rate from the date of receipt of last necessary document to the date of payment. Grievances can be redressed as per the policy’s grievance redressal procedures.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the "Day Care Treatment" category.

Requirements:
- The procedure is undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement.
- The procedure would have otherwise required hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.
- Treatment normally taken on an out-patient basis is not included.

Since the insured person was hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia, and the procedure previously required more than 24 hours, it meets the criteria for Day Care Treatment.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. In a town with less than 1 million population, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. In metropolitan areas (towns with a population of 1 million or more), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. The difference is the minimum number of in-patient beds required: 10 for smaller towns, 15 for metropolitan areas.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A16. Eligibility criteria:

- New employee: Must be an employee of the policyholder (employer-employee relationship).
- Spouse: Must be the employee’s legal spouse or life partner (including live-in partner).
- Sibling: Must be the employee’s sibling, unmarried/unemployed, dependent, and up to 26 years of age.

Documentation and process required:

- Application for cover for each person.
- Additional premium on a pro-rata basis for the coverage duration.
- Endorsement request in writing by the policyholder.
- Any additional information/documents as requested by the underwriter.
- For sibling: Proof of relationship, age, dependency, and unmarried/unemployed status.
- For spouse: Proof of marriage or partnership.
- For employee: Proof of employment and joining date.

Coverage is effective from the date of joining or date of premium payment, whichever is later, after acceptance and issuance of endorsement.

Q17. Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A17. Processing timed out for this question.

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. For air ambulance evacuation following an accident with subsequent inpatient admission, the following steps and requirements must be followed:

Pre-Authorization:
- Notify the insurer or TPA at the call centre or in writing within 10 days from the date of the accident.
- Submit a pre-authorization request to the insurer/TPA with all relevant medical details.
- The TPA will check with the Network Provider whether pre-authorization has been utilized and if all dues are settled.
- If pre-authorization is denied due to insufficient medical details, treatment can still proceed, but claims must be submitted for reimbursement.

Claims Assessment:
- For reimbursement, payment must be made up-front at non-network hospitals.
- Submit all necessary claim documents to the TPA within the prescribed time limit.
- Claims for pre- and post-hospitalisation will be settled on a reimbursement basis upon production of relevant claim papers and cash receipts.
- In case of admission in PPN hospitals, submit the duly filled and signed PPN declaration format available with the hospital.

Mandatory Requirements and Documentation:
- Claim intimation within 10 days of the accident.
- Pre-authorization request with complete medical details.
- Settlement of all non-admissible expenses, sub-limits, co-payments, and deductibles directly with the hospital.
- Submission of all required claim documents, including cash receipts and supporting documents, within the prescribed time limit.
- PPN declaration form (if admitted in a PPN hospital).

Required documents: All documents mentioned in the Base Cover claim reimbursement process, plus any additional documents specified for the respective options, cash receipts, supporting documents for pre- and post-hospitalisation, and the PPN declaration format if applicable.

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If the insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer and recently ported to this policy, the waiting period for a specific illness (such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) will be reduced by the period of continuous coverage under the previous policy, as per IRDAI portability guidelines. Any increase in Sum Insured under the new policy will have the waiting period apply afresh only to the increased amount.

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. The expense will not be covered if the imported medication is considered experimental or unproven in medical practice in India. For coverage, the treatment must be medically necessary, prescribed by a medical practitioner, and conform to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India. If the medication does not meet these criteria, it is excluded from coverage.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. For a non-employer group policy, if a member dies during the policy period, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured, as specified in the Policy Schedule.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the required supporting documentation includes the original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries (e.g., stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery). If only a generic invoice is provided without the implant sticker, the claim may be incomplete and could be delayed, denied, or require additional documentation, as the implant sticker is specifically required to validate the use and authenticity of the implanted device.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement if:

- The insured person was hospitalised due to the accident during the policy period.
- The insurance company has accepted the inpatient hospitalisation claim for that accident.
- The home nursing is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse (registered with the Nursing Council of India or a state council).
- The home nursing is for the same condition for which hospitalisation was required.
- The expenses are incurred within the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Required documentation:

- Proof of hospitalisation and discharge summary.
- Accepted inpatient hospitalisation claim.
- Written confirmation from the treating Medical Practitioner that home nursing is medically required.
- Bills and receipts for home nursing services.
- Proof that the nurse is a Qualified Nurse (valid registration certificate).
- Any other documents specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. If the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer will seek details of other available policies of the policyholder and coordinate with other Insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided a written request for the same has been submitted by the Insured Person. If original documents have been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified documents listed under clause VI.5.1 and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer, subject to the company's satisfaction.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. If the insured's hospitalization was solely for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, with no treatment provided, these expenses are not claimable. Diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment are also excluded. Therefore, such hospitalization expenses are not admissible under the policy.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. If there is no prior endorsement for nominee change and the previous nominee has passed away, the insurer will pay the claim amount to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. Their discharge will be treated as full and final settlement of the insurer’s liability under the policy.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization, in the following scenarios:

- When they are not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the insured person was hospitalized.
- When they are ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer, thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home, except when they form part of room expenses.
- When they are not medically necessary or not part of the recuperation process on a short-term basis.
- When they are for cosmetic or plastic surgery or any treatment to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk, certified by the attending medical practitioner.
- When they are for external congenital anomaly or defects.
- When they are not prescribed by a medical practitioner as part of a hospitalization claim or day care procedure.
- When they are not of reasonable charge or not a medically necessary treatment.

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. Expenses will not be reimbursed because the AYUSH hospital must be registered with local authorities to be eligible for claims. Registration is a mandatory criterion, regardless of having qualified practitioners.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. The network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the TPA for the revised diagnosis, treatment plan, or increased cost during hospitalization, following the prescribed process. This ensures continued cashless eligibility.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. The pre-hospitalisation medical expenses claim will be processed only after the main hospitalisation claim has been decided. If submitted before approval of the main inpatient hospitalisation claim, it will not be processed until the main claim decision is made.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A31. Answer not present in documents.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Claims cannot be approved automatically. All claims must follow the defined process, including submission of required documents, medical examination if requested, cooperation in investigation, and assessment by the insurer or TPA. Automatic approval is not permitted under the stated procedures.

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. If a claim has missing documents, the insurer will notify the insured of the deficiency and send up to three reminders. If the deficiency is not rectified within 10 working days, the insurer may deduct the amount related to the deficiency and settle the rest of the claim if otherwise valid.

If a claim is supported by forged or fraudulent documents, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid will be forfeited. Any amount already paid on such claims must be repaid by all recipients, who are jointly and severally liable. The insurer will not repudiate the claim or forfeit benefits on the ground of fraud if the insured can prove the misstatement was unintentional and not deliberate.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. No, you cannot receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization. Only expenses related to the same illness or injury for which in-patient hospitalization was accepted are covered, and unrelated or excluded expenses are not admissible.

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide (as per the context):

- Treatment in any hospital or by any Medical Practitioner or provider specifically excluded by the Insurer and disclosed on its website/notified to policyholders (except for life-threatening situations or following an accident, only up to stabilization stage).
- Treatment for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, or any addictive condition and consequences thereof.
- Treatments received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments, or private beds registered as a nursing home.
- Cosmetic or plastic surgery or any treatment to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, or cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk to the insured (must be certified by the attending Medical Practitioner).
- Treatment related to hazardous or adventure sports.
- Costs of donor screening or costs incurred in an organ transplant surgery involving organs not harvested from a human body.
- Any form of alternative treatment.
- Treatments not supported by a prescription.

Q36. How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A36. I cannot assist with this request. Submitting fraudulent claims is illegal and unethical.
