    """
    Cleans a string by removing common formatting artifacts.

    This function performs the following actions:
    1. Decodes Unicode escape sequences (e.g., '\\u2019' -> 'â€™').
    2. Handles standard C-style backslash escapes (e.g., '\\"' -> '"', '\\n' -> newline).
    3. Unescapes HTML entities (e.g., '&amp;' -> '&', '&quot;' -> '"').
    4. Normalizes whitespace by replacing multiple spaces/tabs/newlines with a single space.
    5. Strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the final text.

    Args:
        raw_text: The input string with formatting artifacts.

    Returns:
        A cleaned, more readable version of the string.
