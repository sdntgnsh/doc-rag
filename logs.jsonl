  ],
  "answers": [
    "Quantity of motion is defined as the product of the quantity of matter and its velocity (celerity), meaning it is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the quantity of matter and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple. Force, specifically motive force, is distinct in that it arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. Thus, quantity of motion measures the motion present, while force measures the cause that changes or generates motion.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as the Earth and the Moon, are equal and opposite.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law. The key concepts are central force, conservation of angular momentum, and the area law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing that the centripetal forces required to keep moons or planets in orbit follow the same inverse square law, as indicated by the periodic times of their orbits. Thus, the total gravitational force between two masses is the sum of the forces from all their parts, each following the inverse square law, resulting in the overall force being inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies, including planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter, establishing the principle of universal gravitation.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these forces results in complex, time-dependent variations in each planet’s trajectory, known as orbital perturbations.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he admired the taste and form of demonstration of the ancients, preferring geometric proofs, and he regretted not following their style more closely. Additionally, he was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his repugnance to contest or dispute.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in media like air or fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the medium and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones, even if their densities are equal. In sufficiently fluid media, such as air, water, and certain oils, resistance is primarily determined by density and velocity squared. He also distinguishes three sources of resistance in fluids: inactivity of the fluid matter, tenacity of its parts, and friction. The resistance cannot be reduced by making the fluid's particles finer if the density remains the same. Newton uses experiments, such as with pendulums, to confirm his theory of resistance in fluids.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging framework. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nThis distinction supports Newton's laws by providing a universal reference frame for defining true motion and acceleration. Newton's first law (inertia) and second law (F=ma) require an absolute frame to distinguish between real forces and apparent forces caused by acceleration relative to absolute space. Thus, absolute space and time ensure Newton's laws apply consistently and objectively.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."

  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure of motion in a body, calculated by multiplying its mass by its velocity (momentum). It is distinct from 'force' because 'force' refers to the action that changes the state of motion of a body, while 'quantity of motion' describes the current state of motion (momentum) the body possesses.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion: planets move in orbits due to inertia (First Law), gravitational force causes their acceleration (Second Law), and the mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies demonstrates action and reaction (Third Law).",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun (gravity). This central force produces zero torque about the Sun, so the planet's angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by formulating the law of universal gravitation, which states that the gravitational force (F) between two masses (m₁ and m₂) is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between their centers. Mathematically, F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r², where G is the gravitational constant. This relationship shows that as the distance between the masses increases, the gravitational force decreases by the square of that distance.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because mass is the property that causes and experiences gravity; if gravity did not act equally on all masses, the laws of motion and the principle of universal gravitation would be violated, leading to inconsistencies in the observed motions of celestial and terrestrial bodies. Universal gravitation ensures that every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, maintaining consistency in the behavior of objects throughout the universe.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. Each planet attracts every other planet according to the law of universal gravitation, causing deviations from perfect elliptical orbits. These mutual gravitational interactions lead to changes in orbital elements such as eccentricity, inclination, and orientation, resulting in complex, perturbed paths rather than simple ellipses.",
    "Newton used mathematical tools such as the method of \"first and last ratios\" and geometric arguments involving limits and infinitesimals in Principia. These methods are precursors to calculus, allowing him to analyze motion, change, and areas under curves. He did not use standard calculus notation because, at the time, calculus notation (such as Leibniz’s dx and dy) had not yet been widely adopted or standardized. Newton preferred geometric proofs to make his work more rigorous and acceptable to the mathematical community of his era, which was skeptical of the new and not yet formalized calculus methods.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force pulls the body toward the center of its orbit, counteracting its inertia, and prevents it from moving in a straight line. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable elliptical orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by incorporating resistive forces (like drag or friction) that act opposite to the direction of motion. These resistive forces are added to Newton’s second law (F = ma) as negative terms. The magnitude of the resistive force typically depends on the velocity of the object—proportional to velocity for low speeds (linear drag) and proportional to the square of velocity for higher speeds (quadratic drag). The net force on the object is the sum of all applied forces minus the resistive force, resulting in a reduced acceleration and eventual terminal velocity when the resistive force balances the driving force.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nNewton's absolute space and time support his laws by providing a universal frame in which his laws of motion—especially inertia and acceleration—can be defined objectively. This allows for the distinction between true motion (motion relative to absolute space) and apparent motion (motion relative to other objects), ensuring the consistency and universality of Newton's laws.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."

  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure of motion in a body, calculated by multiplying its mass by its velocity (momentum). It is distinct from 'force' because 'force' refers to the action that changes the state of motion of a body, while 'quantity of motion' describes the current state of motion (momentum) the body possesses.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion: planets move in orbits due to inertia (First Law), gravitational force causes their acceleration (Second Law), and the mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies demonstrates action and reaction (Third Law).",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun (gravity). This central force produces zero torque about the Sun, so the planet's angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by formulating the law of universal gravitation, which states that the gravitational force (F) between two masses (m₁ and m₂) is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between their centers. Mathematically, F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r², where G is the gravitational constant. This relationship shows that as the distance between the masses increases, the gravitational force decreases by the square of that distance.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because mass is the property that causes and experiences gravity; if gravity did not act equally on all masses, the laws of motion and the principle of universal gravitation would be violated, leading to inconsistencies in the observed motions of celestial and terrestrial bodies. Universal gravitation ensures that every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, maintaining consistency in the behavior of objects throughout the universe.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. Each planet attracts every other planet according to the law of universal gravitation, causing deviations from perfect elliptical orbits. These mutual gravitational interactions lead to changes in orbital elements such as eccentricity, inclination, and orientation, resulting in complex, perturbed paths rather than simple ellipses.",
    "Newton used mathematical tools such as the method of \"first and last ratios\" and geometric arguments involving limits and infinitesimals in Principia. These methods are precursors to calculus, allowing him to analyze motion, change, and areas under curves. He did not use standard calculus notation because, at the time, calculus notation (such as Leibniz’s dx and dy) had not yet been widely adopted or standardized. Newton preferred geometric proofs to make his work more rigorous and acceptable to the mathematical community of his era, which was skeptical of the new and not yet formalized calculus methods.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force pulls the body toward the center of its orbit, counteracting its inertia, and prevents it from moving in a straight line. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable elliptical orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by incorporating resistive forces (like drag or friction) that act opposite to the direction of motion. These resistive forces are added to Newton’s second law (F = ma) as negative terms. The magnitude of the resistive force typically depends on the velocity of the object—proportional to velocity for low speeds (linear drag) and proportional to the square of velocity for higher speeds (quadratic drag). The net force on the object is the sum of all applied forces minus the resistive force, resulting in a reduced acceleration and eventual terminal velocity when the resistive force balances the driving force.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nNewton's absolute space and time support his laws by providing a universal frame in which his laws of motion—especially inertia and acceleration—can be defined objectively. This allows for the distinction between true motion (motion relative to absolute space) and apparent motion (motion relative to other objects), ensuring the consistency and universality of Newton's laws.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."

If your sum insured with HDFC is Rs 200,000 and they have paid that amount, you cannot claim the excess with another insurer unless you have a separate policy with a different sum insured and follow contribution rules."

    "The newborn's treatment expenses are eligible for a claim.\n\nHere's the breakdown based on the policy:\n\n1.  **New Born Baby Definition:** A \"New Born Baby\" is defined as a baby born during the Policy period and aged up to 90 days (Page 19, II. DEFINITIONS, 31). The newborn in this scenario falls within this definition.\n2.  **New Born Baby Benefit Cover:** \"New Born Babies will be accepted for cover... from birth if mother is covered and maternity cover is opted\" (Page 27, B.Specific Terms and Clauses, 3. Eligibility, d). The mother had maternity cover, fulfilling this condition. Acceptance is subject to the limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, written notification on or before the last day of the month following the birth, and receipt of the agreed premium.\n3.  **Maternity Expenses:** \"Medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections incurred during hospitalisation)\" are covered (Page 20, II. DEFINITIONS, 23).\n4.  **In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover:** This includes \"Charges for accommodation in ICU/CCU/HDU up to the category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule/ Certificate of Insurance or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less\" (Page 22, A. Base Covers, 1.In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover, B).\n5.  **Maternity Exclusion (Code-Excl18):** This exclusion lists \"Medical treatment expenses traceable to child birth (Including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections incurred during hospitalisation) except ectopic pregnancy\" and \"Expenses towards miscarriage (unless due to an accident)\". The scenario of a newborn requiring intensive care after a complicated C-section is not excluded under this clause (Page 24, IV.PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS & WAITING PERIODS, B.Standard Permanent Exclusions, 18).",
    "Yes, the provided documents should be sufficient.\n\nJustification:\n1.  **Medical Advice and Prescription:** The policy states that expenses are covered when incurred on the \"written Medical Advice of a Medical Practitioner\" and are for \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" which \"must have been prescribed by a medical practitioner\" (Page 22, A. Base Covers; Page 20, II. DEFINITIONS, A.Standard Definitions, 27.Medically Necessary Treatment). A \"Medical Practitioner\" is defined as a person holding a valid registration from the Medical Council of any State or Medical Council of India, or other specified councils, and entitled to practice medicine within their jurisdiction (Page 20, II. DEFINITIONS, A.Standard Definitions, 26.Medical Practitioner). A general practitioner falls under this definition, thus their prescription is acceptable.\n2.  **Mental Healthcare Professional:** A \"Clinical Psychologist\" is explicitly defined as a \"Mental Healthcare Professional\" (Page 21, II. DEFINITIONS, B.Specific Definitions, 27.Mental Healthcare Professional). Therefore, a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist is a valid document from a recognized mental healthcare professional.\n3.  **Claim Documents:** The required claim documents include an \"Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner\" and \"Medical history of the patient as recorded... supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner/ hospital\" (Page 30, VI.CLAIM PROCEDURE, 5. Documents, i.iv. and i.v.). The general practitioner's prescription fulfills the requirement for medical advice from a Medical Practitioner, and the Clinical Psychologist's certified discharge summary provides the necessary supporting details from a qualified mental health professional.",

    "Both the pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed.\n\n1.  **Pre-hospitalisation expenses**: The policy covers pre-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred up to **30 days** prior to admission (Page 2, Base Covers; Page 22, Clause III.A.3). Since the expenses occurred 18 days before admission, they fall within this limit.\n2.  **Post-hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses**: The policy covers post-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred up to **60 days** after discharge (Page 2, Base Covers; Page 22, Clause III.A.4). Since these expenses occurred 20 days after discharge, they fall within this limit.\n\nBoth are subject to the condition that an in-patient hospitalization claim for the same illness or injury has been accepted (Page 22, Clause III.A.3(i) and III.A.4(i)).",

  ],
  "answers": [
    "No, you cannot raise the remaining Rs 50,000 with another insurer for the same hospitalization if the total claim has already been settled and approved for Rs 200,000 by HDFC. The policy covers expenses up to the sum insured per policy, and claims cannot be split or duplicated across insurers for the same event beyond the actual expenses incurred and the sum insured limits. If your sum insured with HDFC is Rs 200,000 and they have paid that amount, you cannot claim the excess with another insurer unless you have a separate policy with a different sum insured and follow contribution rules."
