  ],
  "answers": [
    "Quantity of motion is defined as the product of the quantity of matter and its velocity (celerity), meaning it is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the quantity of matter and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple. Force, specifically motive force, is distinct in that it arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. Thus, quantity of motion measures the motion present, while force measures the cause that changes or generates motion.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as the Earth and the Moon, are equal and opposite.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law. The key concepts are central force, conservation of angular momentum, and the area law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing that the centripetal forces required to keep moons or planets in orbit follow the same inverse square law, as indicated by the periodic times of their orbits. Thus, the total gravitational force between two masses is the sum of the forces from all their parts, each following the inverse square law, resulting in the overall force being inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies, including planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter, establishing the principle of universal gravitation.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these forces results in complex, time-dependent variations in each planet’s trajectory, known as orbital perturbations.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he admired the taste and form of demonstration of the ancients, preferring geometric proofs, and he regretted not following their style more closely. Additionally, he was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his repugnance to contest or dispute.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in media like air or fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the medium and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones, even if their densities are equal. In sufficiently fluid media, such as air, water, and certain oils, resistance is primarily determined by density and velocity squared. He also distinguishes three sources of resistance in fluids: inactivity of the fluid matter, tenacity of its parts, and friction. The resistance cannot be reduced by making the fluid's particles finer if the density remains the same. Newton uses experiments, such as with pendulums, to confirm his theory of resistance in fluids.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging framework. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nThis distinction supports Newton's laws by providing a universal reference frame for defining true motion and acceleration. Newton's first law (inertia) and second law (F=ma) require an absolute frame to distinguish between real forces and apparent forces caused by acceleration relative to absolute space. Thus, absolute space and time ensure Newton's laws apply consistently and objectively.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."

    "No, you cannot raise the remaining Rs 50,000 with another insurer for the same hospitalization if the full claim of Rs 200,000 has already been approved and settled by HDFC under the policy. The policy covers expenses up to the sum insured per policy period, and once the claim is settled for the admissible amount, the remaining expenses cannot be claimed again with another insurer for the same event. Double claiming for the same expenses is not permitted."
