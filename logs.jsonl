  ],
  "answers": [
    "No, you cannot raise the remaining Rs 50,000 with another insurer if the hospitalization claim for Rs 200,000 has already been approved and settled by HDFC for the same hospitalization event. Claims for the same hospitalization cannot be reimbursed by multiple insurers beyond the actual expenses incurred, and double compensation is not permitted. You can only claim up to the total admissible expenses incurred, and if one insurer has already settled the claim, the remaining amount cannot be claimed separately with another insurer for the same event."

  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass) in a body. It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.\n\n'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction Law): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion: planets move in orbits due to inertia (First Law), gravitational force causes their acceleration (Second Law), and the mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies demonstrates action and reaction (Third Law).",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravity experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force produces zero torque about the Sun, so the planet's angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. For two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing that the centripetal forces keeping moons or planets in orbit follow the same inverse square law, as indicated by their periodic times and Kepler’s laws. Thus, the total gravitational force between two masses is the sum of the forces from all their parts, each following the inverse square law with respect to distance.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies—planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter—demonstrating a universal principle of attraction among all masses.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these forces results in complex, time-dependent variations in each planet’s trajectory, known as orbital perturbations.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and the concept of \"fluxions\" (his term for derivatives) as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the demonstrations of ancient mathematicians, and was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his aversion to controversy and dispute. The formal principle of his fluxionary calculus was first introduced in the second Lemma of the second book, but he avoided algebraic notation and the differential method in favor of geometric arguments.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is directed toward the center of the orbit and is necessary to keep the body moving in its curved trajectory rather than in a straight line. In the case of planetary motion, gravity provides the required centripetal force, causing the planet to accelerate toward the Sun and thus maintain its elliptical orbit.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that lighter fluids like air offer less resistance than denser ones like water or mercury, in direct proportion to their densities. The resistance in fluids arises from three factors: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. For sufficiently fluid substances, resistance is mainly determined by density and velocity squared. Newton also distinguishes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less tenacious ones, even if their densities are equal. He uses experiments, such as those with pendulums, to confirm his theories about resistance in fluids.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging framework. Absolute space is the same everywhere and does not depend on the presence or motion of objects; absolute time flows uniformly, unaffected by events. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nThis distinction supports Newton's laws by providing a universal reference frame for defining true motion and acceleration. Newton's first law (inertia) and second law (F=ma) require an absolute frame to distinguish between real forces and apparent forces arising from relative or non-inertial motion. Thus, absolute space and time ensure the consistency and universality of Newton's laws of motion.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."

  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass) in a body. It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.\n\n'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction Law): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion: planets move in orbits due to inertia (First Law), gravitational force causes their acceleration (Second Law), and the mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies demonstrates action and reaction (Third Law).",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravity experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force produces zero torque about the Sun, so the planet's angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. For two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing that the centripetal forces keeping moons or planets in orbit follow the same inverse square law, as indicated by their periodic times and Kepler’s laws. Thus, the total gravitational force between two masses is the sum of the forces from all their parts, each following the inverse square law with respect to distance.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies—planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter—demonstrating a universal principle of attraction among all masses.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these forces results in complex, time-dependent variations in each planet’s trajectory, known as orbital perturbations.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and the concept of \"fluxions\" (his term for derivatives) as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the demonstrations of ancient mathematicians, and was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his aversion to controversy and dispute. The formal principle of his fluxionary calculus was first introduced in the second Lemma of the second book, but he avoided algebraic notation and the differential method in favor of geometric arguments.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is directed toward the center of the orbit and is necessary to keep the body moving in its curved trajectory rather than in a straight line. In the case of planetary motion, gravity provides the required centripetal force, causing the planet to accelerate toward the Sun and thus maintain its elliptical orbit.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that lighter fluids like air offer less resistance than denser ones like water or mercury, in direct proportion to their densities. The resistance in fluids arises from three factors: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. For sufficiently fluid substances, resistance is mainly determined by density and velocity squared. Newton also distinguishes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less tenacious ones, even if their densities are equal. He uses experiments, such as those with pendulums, to confirm his theories about resistance in fluids.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging framework. Absolute space is the same everywhere and does not depend on the presence or motion of objects; absolute time flows uniformly, unaffected by events. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nThis distinction supports Newton's laws by providing a universal reference frame for defining true motion and acceleration. Newton's first law (inertia) and second law (F=ma) require an absolute frame to distinguish between real forces and apparent forces arising from relative or non-inertial motion. Thus, absolute space and time ensure the consistency and universality of Newton's laws of motion.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."
