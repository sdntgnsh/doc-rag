    "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?"
  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body, so in a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.\n\n'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as the Earth and the Moon, are equal and opposite.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravity experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. For two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing that the centripetal forces keeping moons or planets in orbit follow the same inverse square law, as indicated by their periodic times and orbital distances. Thus, the total gravitational force between two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating their centers.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies—planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter—demonstrating a universal principle of attraction among all masses.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities or perturbations in the motion of each planet. The superposition of these gravitational influences alters the orbital elements, such as eccentricity and inclination, resulting in complex, non-Keplerian motion.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and the concept of \"fluxions\" (his term for derivatives) as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the ancient mathematicians' methods, and was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his aversion to controversy and disputes.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In the case of planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that lighter fluids like air offer less resistance than denser ones like water or mercury, in direct proportion to their densities. The resistance in fluids arises from three sources: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. For sufficiently fluid substances, resistance is mainly due to density and velocity squared. Newton also distinguishes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less tenacious ones, even if their densities are equal. He provides methods to determine the density of the medium and the resistance encountered by a body moving along a given curve, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is immovable and not dependent on any physical objects, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of events. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nNewton's absolute space and time support his laws by providing a universal frame in which his laws of motion—especially inertia and acceleration—can be objectively defined and measured. This allows for the distinction between true motion (relative to absolute space) and apparent motion (relative to other objects), ensuring the consistency and universality of Newton's laws.",
    "Isaac Newton's paternal grandfather was Robert Newton, and his maternal grandfather was James Ayscough.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."

    "No, this is not sufficient. The required documents for an inpatient psychiatric treatment claim include a discharge certificate/summary from the hospital and a prescription from the attending medical practitioner. The definitions specify that a Medical Practitioner must hold valid registration from the Medical Council of India or a State Medical Council. A general practitioner’s prescription is acceptable if the practitioner is registered as required. However, a discharge summary certified only by a Clinical Psychologist is not sufficient, as a Clinical Psychologist is not recognized as a Medical Practitioner under the policy rules. The discharge summary must be certified by a registered Medical Practitioner (such as a psychiatrist or physician) with the appropriate medical council registration. Therefore, both the prescription and the discharge summary must be from eligible medical practitioners as defined, not solely from a Clinical Psychologist.",
