    "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?"
  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body, so for a body with double the mass at equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.\n\n'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as a planet and the Sun, are equal and opposite.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun (gravity). This central force produces zero torque about the Sun, so the planet's angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing the motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow Kepler’s laws and thus require a centripetal force that varies inversely with the square of the distance from the center. Newton further explains that the total gravitational force from a planet is the sum of the forces from all its parts, each following the inverse square law, and this law holds accurately at large distances and nearly so near the planet’s surface.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate toward each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The moon gravitates toward the earth, the sea gravitates toward the moon, all planets mutually gravitate toward one another, and comets gravitate toward the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This universal gravitation applies to every particle of matter, establishing that all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to changes in orbital elements such as eccentricity, inclination, and orientation. The superposition of these forces results in complex, time-dependent variations in each planet’s trajectory, known as orbital perturbations.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he admired the taste and form of demonstration of the ancients, preferring geometric proofs, and he regretted not following their style more closely. Additionally, he was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his repugnance to contest or dispute.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He distinguishes between different types of resistance—arising from the inactivity of the fluid, the tenacity of its parts, or friction. In sufficiently fluid media like air, water, and certain oils, resistance is mainly proportional to density. He also notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones of equal density. Newton provides methods to determine the density of the medium and the resistance encountered by a body moving along a given curve, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and does not depend on the position or motion of objects, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of events. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nNewton's laws, especially the first law (law of inertia), require a fixed reference frame to define true motion and rest. Absolute space and time provide this universal frame, allowing Newton to distinguish between true motion (relative to absolute space) and apparent motion (relative to other objects). This distinction is essential for formulating and applying his laws of motion consistently.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."

    "Based on the policy documents, the limits for the specified expenses are as follows:\n\n*   **Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM):** As one of the \"12 Modern treatments as per IRDAI,\" the expense for IONM is restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).\n\n*   **ICU Care:** The expense for ICU care is limited to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI), which is inclusive of nursing charges. While the policy defines hospital criteria based on city population (e.g., requiring at least 15 beds in cities with over 1,000,000 people), this does not change the ICU expense limit, which remains at 4% of the SI.",
    "Based on the provided policy document, here is the process and potential reasons for refusal for adding a newly-adopted 3-year-old child:\n\n### **Process for Adding the Child**\n\nThe policyholder must submit a written request to add the child.

While not explicitly stated for adoption, a request made outside a contractually defined period for life events may be refused.",
    "Based on the policy, the claim process for both the day care procedure and the subsequent hospitalization for complications would be on a reimbursement basis, as the latter occurred in a non-network hospital. The complication, occurring within 45 days, is considered a relapse and part of the same illness claim.\n\n### **1. Claim Process for Day Care Cataract Procedure**\n\nSince this is typically a planned procedure, you must follow the reimbursement process.\n\n*   **Claim Notification:** You must notify the TPA at least 48 hours prior to admission to the hospital.\n*   **Document Submission:** After discharge, you must submit the required documents to the TPA within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of discharge.\n\n**Required Documents for Reimbursement:**\nThe claim must be supported by the following original documents:\n*   Duly completed claim form;\n*   Photo ID and Age proof;\n*   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;\n*   Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.\n*   Medical history of the patient as recorded (All previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for current ailment), bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner/ hospital\n*   Discharge certificate/ summary from the hospital.\n*   Photo ID and Age proof;\n*   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;\n*   Original final Hospital bill with detailed break-up with all original deposit and final payment receipt;\n*   Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery;\n*   All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) along with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice / bill with receipt from diagnostic center;\n*   All original medicine / pharmacy bills along with the Medical Practitioner's prescription;\n*   MLC / FIR copy in Accidental cases only;\n*   Copy of death summary and copy of death certificate (in death claims only);\n*   Pre and post-operative imaging reports;\n*   Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history of the Insured Person, treatment details and the Insured Person's progress;\n*   Cheque copy with name of proposer printed on the cheque leaf or copy of the first page of the bank passbook or the bank statement not later than 3 months.\n\n### **2. Claim Process for Complications (Inpatient Care)**\n\nSince this is an emergency hospitalization in a non-network hospital, you must pay the expenses upfront and file for reimbursement.\n\n*   **Claim Notification:** You must notify the TPA within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalization or before discharge from the hospital, whichever is earlier.\n*   **Document Submission:** You must submit the required documents to the TPA within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of discharge.\n\n**Required Documents for Reimbursement:**\nThe same set of original documents as listed above is required for the inpatient care claim.",
    "Based on the policy terms, the newborn's intensive care treatment expenses are eligible for a claim.\n\nHere is the breakdown based on the provided document:\n\n*   **Newborn Coverage:** The policy explicitly states under \"Other Special Condition Details\" that the \"Baby Covered from Day 1 within Family Sum Insured\" (Page 4). This means the newborn is considered an insured person from the moment of birth.\n*   **Eligibility:** The conditions for this coverage, as per the \"Eligibility\" clause (Page 27), are that the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted for, which is the case in this scenario.\n*   **Definition:** The infant qualifies as a \"New Born Baby,\" which is defined as a \"baby born during the Policy period and is aged up to 90 days\" (Page 19).\n*   **Exclusions:** While the policy excludes \"Medical treatment expenses traceable to child birth\" (Page 25), this typically refers to the standard costs of the delivery procedure itself, which are covered under the mother's separate Maternity Benefit. The newborn's need for separate intensive care is a distinct medical event for a newly insured person and is therefore not subject to this exclusion.\n\nTherefore, the costs for the intensive care the newborn received before expiring are admissible for a claim under the family's sum insured.",
    "No, this is not sufficient.\n\nHere is the justification based on the policy document:\n\n1.  **Eligible Practitioners for Claim Documentation:** According to the claim procedure for reimbursement (Clause VI.A.5.i.iv), the claim must be supported by an \"Attending **medical practitioner's / surgeon's** certificate regarding diagnosis\".\n2.  **Definition of \"Medical Practitioner\":** The policy defines a \"Medical Practitioner\" (Clause II.A.26) as a person with a valid registration from the Medical Council of India or equivalent, which includes a General Practitioner and a Psychiatrist.\n3.  **Definition of \"Clinical Psychologist\":** A \"Clinical Psychologist\" is defined under \"Mental Healthcare Professional\" (Clause II.B.27) but is not classified as a \"Medical Practitioner\" or \"Surgeon\".\n\nTherefore, while a General Practitioner's prescription is valid, the discharge summary and diagnostic certificate for an inpatient psychiatric claim must be from the attending **Medical Practitioner** (in this case, a **Psychiatrist**), not a Clinical Psychologist, to be considered sufficient for claim processing.",
    "Based on the annexures provided, here is the admissibility for the requested items:\n\n*   **ECG Electrodes:** Payable, with the constraint that \"Up to 5 electrodes are required for every case visiting OT or ICU. For longer stay in ICU, may require a change and at least one set every second day is payable.\"\n*   **Gloves:** Payable, with the constraint that \"Sterilized Gloves payable / unsterilized gloves not payable\".",
    "Based on the policy, both pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed in this scenario.\n\n*   **Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses:** The policy covers actual medical expenses incurred for up to **30 days** before the date of hospital admission for the same illness. Since the expenses occurred 18 days before admission, they fall within the covered period.\n\n*   **Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses:** The policy covers actual medical expenses incurred for up to **60 days** immediately after discharge from the hospital for the same condition. As the expenses for diagnostics and pharmacy were incurred 20 days after discharge, they are within the covered period.",
    "Based on the document, a dependent child is eligible for coverage up to the age of 26. When a dependent insured person ceases to be a dependent (e.g., by turning 27), their coverage ends.\n\nHowever, the policy includes a specific provision stating that coverage can continue until the end of the policy period if it has been \"otherwise agreed specifically.\" Since the premium was paid for the entire coverage year, this implies an agreement for coverage to last until the policy's expiry date. The dependent would then be deleted from the policy at the time of the next renewal.",
    "In case of admission to a room with a rent higher than the eligible limit, the reimbursement for all associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, will be made on a proportionate basis.\n\nThis is governed by the **Proportionate Clause**, as detailed in **Note 1** under the In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover section (Clause III.A.1). The clause states that the reimbursement of all associated medical expenses \"shall be effected in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of Room Rent.\"",
    "Based on the policy document, here is the course of action:\n\n1.  **Document Deficiency and Resubmission:**\n    *   The TPA/Insurer will scrutinize the claim and inform the insured of any missing documents.\n    *   The insured has 10 working days from the first intimation to provide the necessary documents. The insurer will send a maximum of three reminders.\n\n2.  **Claim Rejection Timeline:**\n    *   After receiving the final necessary documents, the company must settle or reject the claim within 15 days.\n    *   If the claim is rejected, the company will communicate the grounds for rejection in writing.\n\n3.  **Contesting the Final Rejection:**\n    *   **Step 1: Reconsideration:** The insured person may, within 15 days of receiving the rejection, request that the insurer reconsider the decision.\n    *   **Step 2: Grievance Redressal:** If still unsatisfied, the insured can contact the company's grievance redressal channels:\n        *   **Website:** www.uiic.co.in\n        *   **Toll free:** 1800 425 333 33\n        *   **E-mail:** customercare@uiic.co.in\n        *   **Courier:** Customer Care Department, Head Office, United India Insurance Co.

    "Based on the policy terms, the expense for an imported medication not normally used in India is unlikely to be covered. The policy contains several clauses that would likely lead to the denial of such a claim.\n\nRelevant clauses include:\n\n*   **Medically Necessary Treatment (Clause II.A.27):** For a treatment to be covered, it must, among other criteria, \"conform to the professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India\" and must not be \"experimental, investigational or for research purposes.\" An imported drug not standard in India could be deemed experimental or not conforming to accepted standards.\n\n*   **Unproven Treatments (Clause IV.B.16, Code-Excl16):** The policy excludes \"Expenses related to any unproven treatment, services and supplies...

  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body, so in a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.\n\n'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction Law): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies the effect of gravitational force on planetary acceleration. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies, ensuring that forces between them are equal and opposite.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means that the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time, which is Kepler's Second Law. The key concepts are central force, conservation of angular momentum, and the area law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing the motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow Kepler’s laws and thus require a centripetal force that varies inversely with the square of the distance from the center. Newton further explains that the total gravitational force from a planet is the sum of the forces from all its parts, each following the inverse square law, and this holds true both at large distances and near the planet’s surface.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. This mutual gravitation is observed between the earth and objects near it, between the earth and the moon, between the sea and the moon, among all the planets, and between comets and the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Therefore, every particle of matter attracts every other particle, establishing the principle of universal gravitation.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these forces results in complex, non-Keplerian motion, known as orbital perturbations.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and the concept of \"fluxions\" (his term for derivatives) as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the ancient mathematicians' methods, and was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his aversion to controversy and disputes.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that lighter fluids like air offer less resistance than denser ones like water or mercury, in direct proportion to their densities. The resistance in fluids arises from three factors: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. For sufficiently fluid substances, resistance is mainly determined by density and velocity squared. Newton also distinguishes that more viscous fluids resist more than less viscous ones, even if their densities are equal. He analyzes the resistance mathematically and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging framework. Absolute space is the same everywhere and does not depend on the presence or motion of objects; absolute time flows uniformly without relation to anything external. In contrast, relative motion refers to the movement of objects only in relation to each other or to a chosen reference frame. Newton's absolute space and time support his laws by providing a universal reference for defining true motion, acceleration, and force, ensuring that his laws of motion and universal gravitation apply consistently regardless of the observer's state of motion.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."

  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body, so for a body with double the mass at the same velocity, the quantity of motion is doubled; with twice the velocity, it is quadrupled.\n\n'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion: planets move in orbits due to inertia (First Law), gravitational force causes acceleration and determines orbital paths (Second Law), and gravitational interactions between celestial bodies involve equal and opposite forces (Third Law).",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means that the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time, which is Kepler's Second Law. The key concepts are central force, conservation of angular momentum, and the area law.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is inversely as the square of the distance from that particle. For two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing the motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow Kepler’s laws and thus require a centripetal force that is inversely proportional to the square of their distance from the center. Newton further explains that the total gravitational force from a planet is the sum of the forces from all its parts, each following the inverse square law, and this law holds accurately at large distances and nearly so near the planet’s surface.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to their quantity of matter. The moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, all planets towards one another, and comets towards the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This universal gravitation applies to every particle of matter, indicating that all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities or perturbations in the motion of each planet. The superposition of these gravitational influences alters the planets' velocities and positions over time, resulting in complex orbital paths rather than simple ellipses.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he admired the taste and form of demonstration of the ancients, preferring geometric proofs, and he regretted not following their style more closely. Additionally, he was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his repugnance to contest or dispute.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In the case of planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that lighter fluids like air offer less resistance than denser ones like water or mercury, in direct proportion to their densities. The resistance in fluids arises from three sources: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. For sufficiently fluid substances, resistance is mainly determined by density and velocity squared. Newton also distinguishes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones, even if their densities are equal. He provides methods to calculate the resistance and velocity for bodies moving in given curves, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and does not depend on the presence or motion of objects, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of events. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other or to a chosen reference frame. Newton's laws, especially the first law (inertia) and the second law (F=ma), require absolute space and time to define true motion and acceleration, distinguishing them from merely relative changes, and ensuring the universality and consistency of physical laws.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage."
