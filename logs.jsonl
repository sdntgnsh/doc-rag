  "answers": [
    "In the Principia, Newton defines \"quantity of motion\" as the product of a body's mass and its velocity (momentum). It is distinct from \"force,\" which Newton defines as an action that changes a body's state of motion (i.e., changes its quantity of motion). (Principia, Book I, Definitions I & II)",
    "According to Newton in the *Principia*:\n\n1. **First Law (Inertia):** A body remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a force.\n2. **Second Law (F=ma):** The change of motion (momentum) is proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of the force.\n3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n**Application in celestial mechanics:**  \nNewton used these laws to explain planetary motion, showing that planets move in ellipses due to the gravitational force (an application of the second law), and that mutual gravitational attraction (third law) governs the motions of celestial bodies. The laws underpin his derivation of Kepler’s laws and the universal law of gravitation.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by showing that a planet moving under a central force (like gravity) sweeps out equal areas in equal times because the force acts along the line joining the planet and the Sun. This means the planet’s angular momentum is conserved (Principia, Book 1, Proposition 1, Corollary 1). Thus, the area law follows directly from Newton’s laws of motion.",
    "Newton demonstrates the inverse-square law of gravity in Book I, Proposition 11 and Book III, Proposition 7 of the *Principia*. He shows that the observed planetary motions (Kepler’s laws), especially the elliptical orbits and the area law, require a force directed toward the Sun that decreases with the square of the distance. He mathematically proves that only an inverse-square force produces such orbits, thus establishing gravity’s proportionality to 1/r².",
    "Newton argued that gravitational force must act on all masses universally because observations show that all bodies, regardless of composition, fall at the same rate and celestial motions (e.g., planets, moons) are governed by the same laws. In *Principia* (Book 3, Proposition 6, Corollary 2), he states that gravity \"pertains to all bodies universally\" and that this universality is confirmed by experiments and astronomical phenomena.",
    "Newton explains planetary perturbations as resulting from the mutual gravitational attractions between planets. In *Principia* (Book 1, Book 3), he shows that these additional forces cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed and position. He analyzes these effects using his law of universal gravitation and provides mathematical methods for approximating their influence.",
    "In Principia, Newton used geometric methods—limits, ratios of vanishing quantities, and \"fluxions\" (his term for rates of change)—as precursors to calculus. He avoided standard calculus notation because it was not yet formalized or widely accepted; geometric proofs were considered more rigorous and traditional at the time.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by showing that a centripetal force, directed toward a central body (like the Sun), continually deflects a planet from a straight path, causing it to move in an ellipse. This force is necessary to maintain the planet’s curved orbit, as described in Book I of the *Principia*.",
    "In the Principia, Newton analyzes motion in resisting media by introducing resistance forces proportional to velocity or velocity squared. He shows that such resistance slows bodies, causing their motion to deviate from that in a vacuum, and provides mathematical solutions for these cases (Principia, Book II).",
    "Newton’s absolute space and time are fixed, unchanging frameworks that exist independently of objects or events. Relative motion is movement measured between objects. Newton argued that his laws (especially inertia and gravity) require absolute space and time to define true motion (e.g., acceleration) and forces, not just motion relative to other bodies. This distinction is central in *Principia*, where he uses absolute space to explain phenomena like rotating buckets and planetary orbits.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "Isaac Newton never married and had no known children, so he has no direct descendants."

However, if the land is under your personal cultivation and within the ceiling limit, the State cannot acquire it unless compensation at not less than market value is provided.",
    "No, it is not legal. The Indian Constitution prohibits the employment of children below the age of fourteen years in any factory, mine, or other hazardous employment. Forcing a child to work in such conditions is a violation of the law.",
    "Yes, it may be against your rights. The context states that all citizens have the right to freedom of speech and expression. Stopping you from speaking at a protest could violate this fundamental right, unless restricted by reasonable limitations provided by law.",
    "No, it is not constitutional. The context states that no citizen shall be discriminated against on grounds only of sex in respect of any employment or office under the State, and the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. However, religious denominations have the right to manage their own affairs subject to public order, morality, and health. Therefore, while the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, there may be exceptions if the restriction is claimed as an essential religious practice, but such practices must still conform to constitutional values of equality and non-discrimination. Ultimately, whether such exclusion is constitutional depends on whether it violates the fundamental right to equality and non-discrimination, and this is subject to judicial review.",

    "The right being violated is the protection against exploitation and the right to protection against arrest and detention without due process, as every arrested person must be informed of the grounds of arrest and must not be subjected to forced labour or inhuman treatment. Torture in custody violates these fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution.",
    "No, you cannot be denied admission to a public university solely because you are from a socially and educationally backward community. In fact, the State can make special provisions, including reservations, to advance the interests of such communities. If you are denied admission on this ground, you can file a complaint with the National Commission for Backward Classes, which is empowered to inquire into such complaints and safeguard your rights."

    "In the Principia, Newton defines \"quantity of motion\" as the product of a body's mass and its velocity (Book I, Definition II). It is distinct from \"force,\" which he defines as the action that changes a body's state of motion (Definitions III and IV). \"Quantity of motion\" describes a body's current state; \"force\" causes changes to that state.",
    "**Newton’s Three Laws of Motion (Principia, Book I):**\n\n1. **First Law (Inertia):** A body remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a force.\n2. **Second Law (F=ma):** The change of motion (momentum) is proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of the force.\n3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n**Application in Celestial Mechanics:**  \nNewton applied these laws to explain planetary and lunar motion, showing that celestial bodies move according to the same physical laws as objects on Earth. Gravitational force acts as the force in his second law, causing planets to orbit in ellipses (not straight lines), and mutual gravitational attraction (third law) governs interactions between celestial bodies.",
    "Processing timed out for this question.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance by showing, in Book I and Book III of the *Principia*, that the observed motions of planets (Kepler’s laws, especially the area and harmonic laws) require a centripetal force directed toward the Sun that decreases with the square of the distance. He mathematically proves that only an inverse-square law produces elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus, matching astronomical observations.",
    "Newton argued that gravitational force must act on all masses universally because observations show that all bodies, regardless of composition, fall at the same rate and celestial motions (e.g., planets, moons) are governed by the same laws. In *Principia* (Book 3, Proposition 6, Corollary 2), he states that gravity \"pertains to all bodies universally\" because the phenomena require it, and no experiment shows any body exempt from gravity.",
    "Newton explains planetary perturbations as the result of mutual gravitational attractions between planets. In the Principia (Book 1, Proposition 66; Book 3, Proposition 13), he shows that each planet attracts every other, causing deviations (perturbations) from perfect elliptical orbits predicted by two-body motion. These perturbations are calculated using the law of universal gravitation.",
    "In Principia, Newton used geometric methods—limits, ratios of vanishing quantities, and \"fluxions\" (his term for rates of change)—as precursors to calculus. He avoided standard calculus notation because, at the time (1687), calculus notation was not yet formalized or widely accepted, and geometric proofs were considered more rigorous and acceptable to his contemporaries.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by showing that a centripetal force, directed toward a central body (like the Sun), continually deflects a planet from a straight path, causing it to move in an ellipse. In *Principia*, he demonstrates that this force is necessary to maintain the planet’s curved orbit, and mathematically derives that for planetary motion, the centripetal force decreases with the square of the distance (inverse-square law).",
    "In the Principia, Newton analyzes motion in resisting media by introducing resistance forces proportional to velocity or velocity squared. He shows that such resistance slows bodies, causing their motion to deviate from that in a vacuum, and provides mathematical solutions for these cases (Principia, Book II).",
    "Newton’s absolute space and time are fixed, unchanging frameworks that exist independently of objects or events. Relative motion is movement measured between objects. Newton argued that his laws (especially inertia and gravity) require absolute space and time to define true motion and acceleration, not just motion relative to other bodies. This distinction is central in *Principia* (Scholium to Definitions), where Newton uses absolute space/time to distinguish true forces from apparent ones.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "Isaac Newton never married and had no known children, so he has no direct descendants."
