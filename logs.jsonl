In his words: \"The quantity of motion is the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly.\" (Principia, Book I, Definition II)\n\n\"Force,\" on the other hand, is defined differently. Newton distinguishes between \"impressed force\" (the action that changes motion) and \"inherent force\" (the body's resistance to change). Force is related to the change in quantity of motion, not the motion itself.\n\nIn summary:  \n- **Quantity of motion** = mass × velocity (what we now call momentum)  \n- **Force** = that which changes the quantity of motion (causes acceleration or deceleration)", "According to Isaac Newton in *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, the three laws of motion are:\n\n1. **First Law (Law of Inertia):**  \n   \"Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.\"  \n   *Application in celestial mechanics:* Planets and other celestial bodies will continue moving in straight lines at constant speed unless acted upon by external forces (such as gravity).\n\n2. **Second Law (Law of Acceleration):**  \n   \"The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\"  \n   (Commonly expressed as F = ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.)  \n   *Application in celestial mechanics:* The gravitational force between celestial bodies causes them to accelerate, resulting in curved orbits rather than straight-line motion.\n\n3. **Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction):**  \n   \"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.\"  \n   *Application in celestial mechanics:* When one celestial body (e.g., the Sun) exerts a gravitational force on another (e.g., a planet), the second body exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (the law of equal areas) in *Principia* by showing that a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times if and only if the force acting on it is always directed toward a fixed point (the center of force, e.g., the Sun). \n\nUsing his laws of motion, Newton proves that a central force (one always pointing toward the center) causes the planet’s radius vector to sweep out equal areas in equal times. This is because the component of the force perpendicular to the radius vector is zero, so the rate of change of angular momentum is zero, and angular momentum is conserved. This geometric argument appears in Book I, Proposition 1 and Corollary 1 of the *Principia*.\n\nThus, Newton shows that Kepler’s Second Law is a direct consequence of his laws of motion when the force is central (not necessarily gravitational, but any force directed at the center).", "In *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (Principia), Isaac Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by analyzing planetary motion, particularly Kepler’s laws. In Book I, Proposition 11 and Proposition 75, Newton shows mathematically that if a planet orbits the sun in an ellipse (as described by Kepler’s first law) and sweeps out equal areas in equal times (Kepler’s second law), then the force attracting the planet to the sun must decrease with the square of the distance between them. He derives that the centripetal force required for such motion is proportional to 1/r², where r is the distance between the bodies. This is the basis for Newton’s law of universal gravitation.", "In *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, Newton argues that gravitational force must act on all masses universally because the observed motions of celestial bodies (such as planets, moons, and comets) can only be explained if every mass attracts every other mass. He states that the same force that causes objects to fall on Earth also governs the motions of the Moon and planets. Newton writes that gravity \"pertains to all bodies universally\" (Book III, Proposition 7, Corollary 2), and he supports this by showing that the law of universal gravitation—where force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance—accurately predicts observed phenomena. Thus, he concludes that gravity is a universal property of matter, acting on all masses without exception.", "In the *Principia*, Newton explains that the gravitational attraction of other planets causes perturbations (irregularities) in planetary orbits. While each planet primarily orbits the Sun due to its gravitational pull, the mutual attractions between planets act as additional forces, slightly altering their paths from perfect ellipses. Newton analyzes these effects using his law of universal gravitation and provides mathematical methods (notably in Book 1, Proposition 66 and following) to estimate and describe these perturbations. He acknowledges that these interactions make the orbits more complex but can be accounted for by considering the combined gravitational influences.", "In the *Principia*, Newton primarily used geometric methods, such as the method of \"first and last ratios\" (limits), to solve problems involving motion and change—these are precursors to calculus. He avoided standard calculus notation because, at the time (1687), calculus (which he called \"the method of fluxions\") was not yet widely accepted or formalized, and he wanted his arguments to be rigorous and accessible to mathematicians familiar with classical geometry. Thus, he presented his results using geometric proofs rather than the algebraic notation of calculus.", "In *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain that an object in orbital motion, such as a planet around the Sun, is continually deflected from a straight path by a force directed toward the center of its orbit. This centripetal force causes the object to follow a curved, typically elliptical, path rather than moving in a straight line. Newton mathematically demonstrates that for planetary orbits, this force is proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the center (the law of universal gravitation). Thus, orbital motion results from the balance between the object's inertia (tendency to move in a straight line) and the continuous inward pull of the centripetal (gravitational) force. (Principia, Book I, Propositions 1–3, Book III, Proposition 2)", "In the *Principia*, Newton addresses motion in resisting media (such as air or fluids) primarily in Book II. He analyzes how resistance affects the motion of bodies, distinguishing between two main types of resistance: one proportional to velocity (linear resistance) and one proportional to the square of velocity (quadratic resistance). Newton derives mathematical solutions for the motion of bodies under these resistances, showing, for example, how a falling body's speed approaches a terminal velocity in a resisting medium. He also uses experiments (e.g., pendulum motion) to compare theoretical predictions with observed effects of air resistance.", "Newton’s notion of **absolute space and time** refers to the idea that space and time exist independently of any objects or events—they are fixed, unchanging frameworks. In the *Principia*, Newton distinguishes:\n\n- **Absolute space**: Exists always and is immovable, providing a true reference for motion.\n- **Absolute time**: Flows uniformly, independent of anything external.\n\nIn contrast, **relative motion** is motion measured with respect to other objects (e.g., a ship moving relative to the shore).\n\n**How this supports his laws:**\nNewton’s laws, especially the first and second, require a fixed reference to define true (not just apparent) motion and forces. For example, in his famous \"bucket argument,\" Newton shows that rotation relative to absolute space (not just relative to other objects) produces observable effects (like water climbing the bucket’s sides). Thus, absolute space and time provide the necessary framework for defining inertial frames and applying his laws universally.\n\n(*Principia*, Scholium to Definitions; Book I)", "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.", "Isaac Newton never married and had no known children, so he has no direct descendants."]}
