  ],
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.\n\n'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' because it arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.",
    "Newton’s three laws of motion are:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n3. Third Law (Action-Reaction Law): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies the effect of gravitational force on planetary acceleration. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies, ensuring that forces between two bodies are equal and opposite.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravitational force experiences a central force—meaning the force always points toward the Sun. According to Newton's laws of motion, a central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law. Key concepts: central force, conservation of angular momentum, equal areas in equal times.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is inversely as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship holds for the total gravitational force, which is compounded from the forces towards all parts of a mass, and is confirmed by the observed motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow the same law. Thus, the force of gravity between two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.",
    "Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to their quantity of matter. The moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, all planets towards each other, and comets towards the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This universal gravitation applies to every particle of matter, meaning all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.",
    "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these gravitational influences results in complex, perturbed paths rather than simple two-body motion.",
    "Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the style and rigor of classical geometry, admired the demonstrations of the ancients, and was reluctant to engage in disputes over mathematical methods.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force, directed toward the center of the orbit, causes the body to accelerate toward the center, preventing it from moving in a straight line. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable elliptical orbits around the Sun.",
    "Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the medium and the square of the velocity. He distinguishes between different types of resistance—arising from the inactivity of the fluid, the tenacity of its parts, or friction. In sufficiently fluid media like air, water, and certain oils, resistance is mainly due to density and velocity squared. He also notes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones of equal density. Newton analyzes how resistance affects motion, including circular and projected motion, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.\n\nNewton's laws, especially the first law (inertia) and the second law (F=ma), require a universal, non-arbitrary frame to define true motion and acceleration. Absolute space and time provide this objective framework, allowing for the distinction between true motion (absolute) and apparent motion (relative), and ensuring the consistent application of his laws of motion.",
    "Robert Newton and James Ayscough.",
    "Newton never married and had no children, so no direct descendants exist."
