--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass). It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.

'Force' (specifically motive force) is distinct from quantity of motion; it arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion: planets move in orbits due to inertia (First Law), gravitational force causes their acceleration (Second Law), and the mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies demonstrates action and reaction (Third Law).

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet moving under the influence of the Sun's gravity experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means that the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law. Key concepts: central force, conservation of angular momentum, equal areas in equal times.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is inversely as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing the motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow Kepler’s laws and thus require a centripetal force that varies inversely with the square of the distance from the center. Newton further explains that the total gravitational force from a planet is the sum of the forces from all its parts, each following the inverse square law, and this law holds accurately at large distances and nearly so near the planet’s surface.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies—planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter—demonstrating that universal gravitation is a property of all matter, not limited to specific objects.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities or perturbations in the motion of each planet. The superposition of these forces alters the planets' velocities and positions over time, resulting in complex orbital paths rather than simple ellipses.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used the method of fluxions, which is a precursor to calculus, in the Principia. He introduced the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus in the second Lemma of the second book. Newton did not use standard calculus notation because he admired the taste and form of demonstration of the ancient geometers and preferred their style. He regretted not following the ancients more closely and was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings, partly due to his repugnance to contest or dispute.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force pulls the body toward the center of its orbit, preventing it from moving in a straight line due to inertia. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, causing the planet to follow an elliptical orbit around the Sun. The balance between the planet’s inertia (tendency to move in a straight line) and the gravitational centripetal force results in stable orbital motion.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that lighter fluids like air offer less resistance than denser ones like water or mercury, in direct proportion to their densities. The resistance in fluids arises from three sources: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. For sufficiently fluid substances, resistance is mainly due to density and velocity squared. Newton also distinguishes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less tenacious ones, even if their densities are equal. He provides methods to determine the density of the medium and the resistance encountered by a body moving along a given curve, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.

Newton's absolute space and time support his laws by providing a universal frame in which his laws of motion—especially inertia and acceleration—can be defined objectively. This allows for the distinction between true motion (motion relative to absolute space) and apparent motion (motion relative to other objects), ensuring the consistency and universality of Newton's laws.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage.

The company may accept duly certified documents and claim settlement advice from the other insurer.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.

A1. A female child is covered under the policy until she gets married, which means a 23-year-old financially dependent daughter who recently married may no longer be eligible for coverage in subsequent renewals.

Regarding dental claims:
Dental treatment is generally excluded unless necessitated by an injury. However, for the Platinum Plan, Out-Patient Department (OPD) expenses for Dental and Ophthalmic care are reimbursed up to Rs. 5,000 in a block of every three years. This includes:
*   Out-patient consultations by a medical practitioner.

An unmarried sibling can continue as a dependent if financially dependent, as the policy defines family to include "Unmarried siblings, if financially dependent," without specifying an upper age limit for siblings. The policy does not explicitly address the scenario of a sibling becoming financially dependent again after a period of independence due to job loss.

Q3. While inquiring about the maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law, simultaneously provide the claim notification procedure, and confirm the process to replace a lost ID card for another dependent.
A3. The maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law is up to the Sum Insured available under the chosen plan (Silver, Gold, Diamond, or Platinum), as accidental trauma falls under "Injury" for which hospitalization expenses are covered up to the Sum Insured.

The claim notification procedure requires immediate notice of claim with particulars relating to Policy Number, ID Card No., Name of Insured Person, Nature of disease/Injury, and Name and Address of the attending Medical Practitioner/Hospital/Nursing Home. This notice must be given to the Company/TPA by fax or e-mail within 48 hours of admission but before discharge from the Hospital/Nursing Home, unless waived in writing.

The document does not provide a specific procedure for replacing a lost ID card for a dependent.

Q4. If you wish to admit your 17-year-old son for psychiatric illness to a hospital outside your city, also request an address update for all family members, and inquire about coverage for OPD dental checkups under Gold and Platinum plans.
A4. Your 17-year-old son's psychiatric illness admission to a hospital outside your city is covered, provided the treatment is taken in India and is medically necessary, as per the Mental Illness Cover (3.1.14) and the general policy terms for treatment within India. A dependent male child is covered up to 25 years if he is a bonafide regular student and financially dependent.

To update your address for all family members, you must inform the Company immediately in writing of any change in the address (5.34).

This benefit is applicable only in Diamond and Platinum Plans, and the policy must have been continuously in force for a minimum of 24 months for the insured or spouse.

Mid-term dependent inclusion for a newborn is permitted under the policy upon payment of pro-rata premium, covering the newborn from day one of birth or at the time of renewal.

To change the communication email for the primary insured, the insured must inform the Company immediately in writing of the change.

Q7. For submitting a claim for prosthetic limb implantation after an accident for a dependent, also check eligibility for claim under other group mediclaim policies if sum insured is exhausted, and provide details for nominating a new legal heir.
A7. A claim for prosthetic limb implantation after an accident for a dependent is eligible under the policy, as "Artificial Limbs and similar expenses" are covered under Hospitalisation Benefits, subject to the Sum Insured limits, provided the dependent is an Insured Person named in the Schedule.

If the sum insured is exhausted under one policy, the insured person has the right to claim the balance amount from other group mediclaim policies. If the available coverage under the chosen primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary insurer will coordinate with other insurers to settle the balance.

For nominating a new legal heir, the policyholder must communicate any change of nomination to the company in writing. This change becomes effective only when an endorsement is made on the policy. In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee as named in the Policy Schedule/Certificate/Endorsement, or the legal heirs/representatives if no nominee subsists.

Cashless facility is available at network hospitals/nursing homes with prior pre-admission authorization. The policy excludes mental conditions associated with alcohol and drug abuse, mental retardation, and psychotherapy not requiring hospitalization. The document does not specifically list "Harmony Wellness" as a network provider or a defined Mental Health Establishment.

The critical illness survival benefit details are as follows under the Life Hardship Survival Benefit Plan:

A9. For pre-authorization of air ambulance transfer following a road accident, the process involves submitting a claim through the Company or TPA. Admission must be to a network Hospital/Nursing Home and is subject to pre-admission authorization. The Company/TPA will verify eligibility and issue a pre-authorization letter/guarantee of payment.

Q10. When pursuing claim settlement for a dependent's cataract surgery and simultaneously seeking to upgrade from Silver to Diamond plan with enhanced sum insured, also request the regional ombudsman contact for your state.
A10. Cataract surgery is subject to a 2-year waiting period as per the policy's specified disease/procedure waiting period.

Upgrading from a Silver plan to a Diamond plan with an enhanced sum insured is permissible if no claims have been reported in the two immediate preceding policy periods. This allows for a change to the next plan (Silver to Gold, Gold to Diamond, and Diamond to Platinum) at the initial Sum Insured slab, or two steps higher from the current Sum Insured, whichever is greater, at the Insured's option. However, a change of plan is not allowed for policies covering any person above 70 years of age. For Gold, Diamond, and Platinum plans with a Sum Insured of Rs. 6.0 lacs and above, the room rent limit can be enhanced by 50% or 100% upon payment of an additional premium.

For the regional ombudsman contact, refer to Annexure I of the policy document, which provides contact details for Insurance Ombudsmen offices across various regions in India. The specific contact details will depend on your state.
