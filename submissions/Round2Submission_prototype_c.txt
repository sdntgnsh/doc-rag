Q1. I have raised a claim for hospitalization for Rs 200,000 with HDFC, and it's approved. My total expenses are Rs 250,000. Can I raise the remaining Rs 50,000 with you?
A1. No, you cannot raise the remaining Rs 50,000 with another insurer if the hospitalization claim for the same event has already been approved and settled by HDFC. Claims for the same hospitalization event cannot be reimbursed by multiple insurers beyond the actual expenses incurred, and the total claim amount cannot exceed the total expenses. If you have already received reimbursement for the hospitalization expenses up to the sum insured or as per the policy terms from HDFC, you cannot claim the remaining amount with another insurer for the same event.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Quantity of motion is defined as the product of the velocity (celerity) and the quantity of matter (mass) in a body. It is distinct from force in that quantity of motion measures the motion itself, while force refers to the cause that changes motion. Motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter, whereas quantity of motion arises from velocity multiplied by the quantity of matter.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion: planets move in stable orbits due to inertia (First Law), gravitational force causes acceleration and determines orbital paths (Second Law), and gravitational interactions between celestial bodies involve equal and opposite forces (Third Law).

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means that the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time, which is Kepler's Second Law. Key concepts: central force, conservation of angular momentum, equal areas in equal times.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from that particle. For entire spheres or planets, the total gravitational force is compounded from the forces towards all their parts, and the resulting force between two spheres is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship holds for all planets and bodies, with the gravitational force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate toward each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The moon gravitates toward the earth, the sea gravitates toward the moon, all planets mutually attract one another, and comets are attracted to the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This universal attraction applies to every particle of matter, establishing the principle of universal gravitation.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these gravitational influences produces complex, but predictable, variations in the motion of each planet.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and the concept of "fluxions" as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because, at the time, calculus notation was not yet standardized, and he preferred geometric arguments over algebraic or symbolic methods for rigor and clarity.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus follow a curved, rather than straight, trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He distinguishes between different types of fluids, noting that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones, even if their densities are equal. In sufficiently fluid media like air, water, and certain oils, resistance depends primarily on density and velocity squared. Newton also identifies three sources of resistance in fluids: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. He analyzes how resistance affects motion, provides methods to calculate resistance for different shapes and conditions, and confirms his theories with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging framework. Absolute space is the immovable reference against which all motion is measured, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of external factors. Relative motion, in contrast, is measured only with respect to other objects and can vary depending on the observer's frame of reference. Newton's absolute space and time support his laws by providing a universal standard for defining true motion and acceleration, ensuring that his laws of motion and universal gravitation apply consistently and objectively, independent of any observer's position or movement.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's paternal grandfather was Robert Newton, and his maternal grandfather was James Ayscough.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?
A1. Expenses would NOT be covered if the treatment involves non-medical items such as ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer/thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home (except when they form part of room expenses), or if the treatment is received from a provider specifically excluded by the insurer. Additionally, if the treatment is for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse, or is received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas, or similar establishments, these expenses would also NOT be covered.

Q2. A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?
A2. Payable items: Cost of the prosthetic device implanted during the hip replacement surgery, lumbar belt (only if the surgery involved the lumbar spine). The cost of the walker is not payable.

Q3. An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A3. The insured's child (above 18, under 26, unmarried, unemployed, and dependent) is eligible for coverage. Dental surgery expenses are admissible if the treatment is for reconstruction following an accident, as exclusions for cosmetic or plastic surgery do not apply in this case.

Claim process:
- Submit the claim form along with invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports, all duly signed by the insured person, to the branch or head office.
- The insurer will assess the claim documents for admissibility.
- The claim will be settled or rejected within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document.

For dental surgery after an accident, no pre-authorization is required for dependent children above 18. The claim is admissible if all required documents are provided and the treatment is medically necessary due to the accident.

Q4. If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A4. Expenses for Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period for claims involving IONM, subject to the overall restriction that 12 modern treatments as per IRDAI (including IONM) are limited to 50% of the Sum Insured.

ICU charges, including ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges, are covered up to 4% of the Sum Insured per day (inclusive of nursing charges), as specified in the policy. If the insured is admitted to a higher category room than entitled, the insured will bear the difference of all medical expenses in the same proportion as in the final hospital bill. Actual expenses incurred are covered up to the specified per day limit.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. To add a newly-adopted 3-year-old child as a dependent, the policyholder must submit a written application for cover. The insurer will assess the application, and the child may be added as an Insured Person during the policy period if:

- The application for cover is accepted by the insurer.
- Additional pro-rata premium for the coverage duration is paid.
- The insurer issues an endorsement confirming the addition.

The insurer may refuse cover if:

- The application is not accepted by the insurer.
- Required premium is not paid.
- Required documents or information are not provided.
- The addition does not comply with eligibility criteria (children between 91 days and 18 years are eligible if either or both parents are covered).
- The request is not made within the specified notification period (on or before the last day of the month following the event).

All endorsement requests are subject to underwriter assessment, and additional information/documents may be requested.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. For the day care cataract procedure:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier, or at least 48 hours prior to admission in case of planned hospitalisation.
- For reimbursement of day care expenses, submit all relevant documents to the company/TPA within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

For the subsequent inpatient hospitalisation due to complications in a non-network hospital:

- Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier.
- For reimbursement of hospitalisation expenses, submit all relevant documents to the company/TPA within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

Required documents (for both claims):

- All relevant information relating to the claim, including plan of treatment, policy number, etc., as per the process defined.
- Submit documents immediately after discharge if cashless facility was authorised, or within 15 days of discharge for reimbursement claims.

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. The newborn’s treatment expenses are eligible for claim only if:

- Maternity cover is opted.
- The newborn is accepted as an insured person, which requires written notification to the insurer on or before the last day of the month following birth and payment of the agreed premium.

However, since the newborn expired within 24 hours, eligibility depends on whether the insurer was notified and the premium was paid before the newborn’s demise. If notification and premium payment were completed as required, the newborn’s intensive care expenses are covered under the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, subject to policy limits and exclusions.

If notification and premium payment were not completed before the newborn’s demise, the claim for the newborn’s treatment expenses is not eligible.

Exclusions do not apply to the newborn’s intensive care in this scenario, as the expenses are not for miscarriage or lawful medical termination, and the policy covers medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth, including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections, for both mother and newborn if the above conditions are met.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient. The required documents for an inpatient psychiatric treatment claim include a certificate or prescription from a Medical Practitioner, which is defined as a person holding valid registration from the Medical Council of any State or Medical Council of India. A general practitioner’s prescription is acceptable only if the practitioner meets this definition. However, a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist is not sufficient because a Clinical Psychologist is not recognized as a Medical Practitioner under the policy’s definitions. The discharge summary must be certified by a qualified Medical Practitioner (such as a psychiatrist with medical registration), not solely by a Clinical Psychologist. Therefore, both the prescription and the discharge summary must be from eligible medical professionals as defined, and supporting documents from a Clinical Psychologist alone do not meet the claim document requirements.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. ECG electrodes are admissible up to 5 electrodes per case visiting OT or ICU; for longer ICU stays, at least one set every second day is payable. Gloves are not listed as payable items and are therefore not admissible for reimbursement.

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Pre-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred 18 days before admission for the same illness can be claimed, provided they fall within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is accepted.

Post-hospitalisation medical expenses for diagnostics and pharmacy incurred 20 days after discharge for the same illness can be claimed, provided they are within the pre-defined number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is accepted.

Both pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses must relate to the same illness or injury for which hospitalisation was required, and claims are subject to the policy’s specified time limits and amount limits.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. Coverage for a dependent child continues only up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period, their coverage ceases when they reach 27 years of age, regardless of the premium having been paid for the full year. Deletion is to be effected as soon as the dependent ceases to be eligible (i.e., on turning 27), and the policyholder must notify the insurer of this change. Premium refund for the unexpired period is made on a pro-rata basis, provided no claim has been paid or is outstanding for that insured person.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. Associated expenses such as diagnostic and specialist fees will be reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rent per day bears to the actual room rent per day, as per the Proportionate Clause. This applies because the insured opted for a room costing more than the allowed limit and differential billing is followed. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause for Clause III.A.1.A.

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation and the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, the company may have already deducted the amount related to the deficiency and settled the rest of the claim. If the claim is finally rejected, the company must communicate the rejection in writing, explicitly stating the grounds, within 15 days from receipt of the final documents or investigation report.

The insured person then has 15 days from receipt of the rejection to represent to the company for reconsideration. If the claim is not the subject of any pending suit or proceeding and is not pursued within twelve months from the date of rejection or partial settlement, the claim is deemed abandoned and the company’s liability is extinguished.

If there is a delay in claim payment beyond the stipulated period (15 days from receipt of last necessary document, or 45 days if investigation is required), the company must pay interest at 2% above the bank rate from the date of receipt of last necessary document to the date of payment. Grievances can be redressed as per the company’s grievance redressal procedures.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the category of "Day Care Treatment." 

Requirements:
- The procedure is undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement.
- The procedure would have otherwise required hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.
- Treatment normally taken on an out-patient basis is not included.

Since the insured person was hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia, and the procedure previously required more than 24 hours, it qualifies as Day Care Treatment.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. In a town with less than 1 million population, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. In metropolitan areas (population 1 million or more), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds and qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock. The difference is the minimum number of in-patient beds required: 10 for smaller towns, 15 for metropolitan areas.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A16. Eligibility criteria:

- New employee: Must be an employee of the policyholder (employer-employee relationship).
- Spouse: Must be the employee’s legal spouse or life partner (including live-in partner).
- Sibling: Must be the employee’s sibling, unmarried/unemployed, dependent, and up to 26 years of age.

Documentation and process required:

- Application for cover for each person.
- Additional premium on a pro-rata basis for the coverage duration.

- Notification of the change to the insurer on or before the last day of the succeeding month.

Required documents: Application for cover, written endorsement request, proof of relationship (as applicable), proof of dependency for sibling, and any other documents requested by the underwriter.

Q17. Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A17. Robotic surgery for cancer is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, whether performed as a day care procedure or as inpatient hospitalization. For claims involving malignancies (cancer), the same sub-limit applies in both scenarios. Additionally, modern treatments, including robotic surgery for cancer, are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, the following steps and requirements must be followed for pre-authorization and claims assessment:

Pre-Authorization:
- Notify the insurer or TPA at the call centre or in writing within 10 days from the date of the accident.
- Submit a pre-authorization request to the TPA/hospital, providing all relevant medical details.
- The TPA may deny pre-authorization if relevant medical details are not provided, but treatment can still proceed and claims can be submitted for reimbursement.
- For admission in PPN hospitals, submit the duly filled and signed PPN declaration format available with the hospital.

Claims Assessment:
- Settle all non-admissible expenses, expenses above specified sub-limits, co-payments, and opted deductibles directly with the hospital.
- Submit all required claim documents to the TPA within the prescribed time limit for reimbursement, including:
  - Bills/invoices/medical treatment-related documents in the insured person's name.
  - Cash receipts for pre- and post-hospitalization expenses.
  - Any additional information or assistance as required by the TPA/Company, including authorization to obtain medical and other records.
- Allow examination by a medical practitioner or authorized person if required by the TPA/Company.
- All documents submitted to the TPA will be electronically collected for settlement or denial of the claim.

Mandatory Requirements and Documentation:
- Timely notification (within 10 days) of the accident and claim.
- Submission of pre-authorization request with complete medical details.
- Submission of all original bills, invoices, and medical documents in the insured person's name.
- Submission of PPN declaration format if admitted to a PPN hospital.
- Cooperation with the insurer/TPA in providing additional information and allowing medical examination if requested.
- Submission of claim documents and receipts within the prescribed time limit for reimbursement.

Required documents: Bills/invoices/medical treatment-related documents in the insured person's name, cash receipts, PPN declaration format (if applicable), any additional information or authorizations as required by the TPA/Company.

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If the insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer and recently ported to this policy, the waiting period for a specific illness (such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. Any credits gained for pre-existing diseases and specific waiting periods from the previous policy are carried over, so only the remaining waiting period, if any, would apply under the new policy. All waiting periods apply individually to each insured person, and the exclusion does not apply to claims arising due to an accident. If the sum insured is enhanced, the waiting period applies afresh to the increased amount.

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. The expense will not be covered if the imported medication is considered experimental or unproven in medical practice in India. Coverage is limited to treatments that are medically necessary, prescribed by a medical practitioner, and conform to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India. If the medication does not meet these criteria, it is excluded from coverage.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. For a non-employer group policy, if a member dies during the policy period, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period, at the option of the insured, as specified in the Policy Schedule.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the required supporting documentation includes the original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries (e.g., stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery). If only a generic invoice is provided without the implant sticker, the claim may be delayed, queried, or rejected due to incomplete documentation, as the implant sticker is specifically required to validate the use and authenticity of the implanted device.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement if:

1. The insurer has accepted a claim for in-patient hospitalisation for the same illness or injury.
2. The home nursing is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to provide expert nursing services immediately after discharge.
3. The post-hospitalisation medical expenses, including home nursing, are incurred within the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.
4. The expenses are for the same condition for which hospitalisation was required, and the inpatient hospitalisation claim is admissible.

Required documentation:
- Proof of accepted in-patient hospitalisation claim.
- Hospital arrangement details for home nursing.
- Valid registration certificate of the Qualified Nurse from the Nursing Council of India or any state.
- Bills and receipts for home nursing services.
- Discharge summary from the hospital.
- Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance showing coverage limits.
- Written confirmation from the treating Medical Practitioner if Domiciliary Hospitalisation is involved.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. If the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary insurer will seek details of other available policies from the policyholder. The primary insurer will then coordinate with the other insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount as per the policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request for the same.

If original documents have been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified documents listed under clause VI.5.1 and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer, subject to the company's satisfaction.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded and not claimable. If the hospitalization was solely for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, with no treatment provided, these expenses are not admissible under the policy as per the stated exclusions.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. If there is no prior endorsement for nominee change and the previous nominee has died, the insurer will pay the claim amount to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. Their discharge will be treated as full and final discharge of the insurer’s liability under the policy.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered in the following scenarios, even if associated with hospitalization:

- When they are not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the insured person was hospitalized.
- When used for diagnosis and treatment but are ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer, thermometer, or any medical equipment subsequently used at home (except when forming part of room expenses).
- When they are not medically necessary or are not part of the recuperation process on a short-term basis.
- When they are for cosmetic or plastic surgery or to change appearance, unless for reconstruction following an accident, burns, cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk, certified by the attending medical practitioner.
- When prescribed by persons not registered as Medical Practitioners under the respective Medical Councils, or by a Medical Practitioner practicing outside their licensed discipline.
- When related to external congenital anomaly or defects.
- When used for conditions that could have been treated on an outpatient basis without hospitalization.
- When the treatment or device is not of reasonable charge or not a medically necessary treatment.

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. Expenses will not be reimbursed because the AYUSH hospital must be registered with local authorities, wherever applicable, to be eligible for reimbursement. Having qualified practitioners alone is not sufficient; local registration is a mandatory criterion.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. The network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA for the revised diagnosis, treatment plan, or increased cost during hospitalization, following the prescribed process. This ensures continued cashless eligibility.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. Processing timed out for this question.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?

To nominate a new legal heir, update the nominee details with the insurer as per their prescribed process.
