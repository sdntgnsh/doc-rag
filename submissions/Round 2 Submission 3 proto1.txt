--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Quantity of motion is defined as the product of the quantity of matter and the velocity (celerity) of a body. It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body and increases proportionally with either mass or velocity. In contrast, force (specifically motive force) is the product of the accelerative force and the quantity of matter. Thus, quantity of motion measures the motion present in a body, while force measures the cause that changes or generates that motion.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as a planet and the Sun, are equal and opposite.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun (gravity). This central force produces zero torque about the Sun, so the planet's angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is inversely as the square of the distance from that particle, and that the total gravitational force between two spheres (or masses) is compounded from the forces of gravity towards all their parts. When the matter is distributed similarly and symmetrically, the total gravitational force between the centers of two spheres is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This is confirmed by observing that the centripetal forces required to keep moons or planets in orbit follow the same inverse-square law, as seen in the periodic times of their orbits.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This mutual gravitation applies to all bodies—planets, moons, comets, and every particle of matter—demonstrating a universal principle of attraction.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to irregularities such as changes in orbital speed, direction, and position. The superposition of these gravitational influences results in complex, perturbed paths rather than simple two-body motion.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used geometric methods and his fluxionary calculus (the method of fluxions) as mathematical tools in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the geometric style of the ancients, admired their taste and form of demonstration, and regretted not following them more closely. He also had a repugnance to contest or dispute, which contributed to his reluctance to publish his purely mathematical writings or adopt new notations.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He distinguishes between different types of resistance—arising from the inactivity of the fluid, the tenacity of its parts, or friction. In sufficiently fluid media like air, water, and certain oils, resistance is mainly determined by density and velocity squared. He also notes that more viscous fluids of equal density resist more than less viscous ones. Newton analyzes how to determine the density of the medium and the resistance at each point for a body moving along a given curve, and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.

Newton's laws, especially the first law (law of inertia), require a fixed reference frame to define true motion and rest. Absolute space and time provide this universal frame, allowing Newton to distinguish between true motion (relative to absolute space) and apparent motion (relative to other objects). This distinction is essential for the consistent application of his laws of motion.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage.

Q2. A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?
A2. Based on the policy terms, only the prosthetic device is payable, as it is a cost for a prosthetic device implanted during a surgical procedure.

The walker is not payable, as "Walking Aids Charges" are explicitly listed as "Not Payable." The lumbar belt is also not payable because the policy only covers belts for surgeries of the thoracic or lumbar spine, not for a hip replacement.

Q3. An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A3. ### Claim Admissibility

The claim is admissible. A dependent child over 18 and under 26 is eligible for coverage provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. While dental surgery is typically excluded, the policy covers it when it is necessitated by an accident and requires a minimum of 24 hours of hospitalization.

### Claim Process

The insured must follow the claims procedure for hospitalization.

**1. Notification of Claim:**
Notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalization or before discharge, whichever is earlier.

**2. Procedure for Claims:**
*   **Cashless Claims:** Treatment can be taken at a network/PPN hospital. This is subject to pre-authorization by the TPA. The ID card issued by the TPA must be produced at the hospital's insurance desk.
*   **Reimbursement Claims:** For treatment in non-network hospitals, the payment must be made upfront. The necessary documents must then be submitted to the TPA for reimbursement.

Q4. If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A4. Based on the policy, the expense limits are as follows:

*   **Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM):** As one of the "12 Modern treatments as per IRDAI," expenses for IONM are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).

*   **ICU Care:** Charges for ICU accommodation are limited to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI), inclusive of nursing charges. While the policy defines a hospital in a city with over 1 million people as needing at least 15 in-patient beds, this does not alter the ICU expense limit.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. Based on the policy's eligibility and addition clauses, a newly-adopted child of 3 years can be added as a dependent.

**Process for Adding the Child:**
A child between the ages of 91 days and 18 years is eligible for coverage, provided at least one parent is concurrently covered under the policy. The process to add the child is as follows:
1.  The policyholder must make a written request to the insurer to add the child.
2.  The insurer must accept the application for cover.
3.  An additional premium must be paid on a pro-rata basis for the remaining policy period.
4.  The insurer will issue a written endorsement confirming the addition of the child to the policy.

**Circumstances for Refusal:**
The insurer may refuse to cover the child under the following circumstances:
*   If the eligibility criteria are not met (e.g., neither parent is covered under the policy).
*   The insurer has the right to not accept the application for cover, as the addition is "provided that the application for cover has been accepted by Us".
*   If the policyholder fails to disclose any material facts, misrepresents information, or engages in fraud during the application process to add the child.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. ### **Claim Process for Both Events**

**1. Day Care Cataract Procedure (Planned Hospitalization)**

*   **Claim Notification:** The TPA must be notified at least 48 hours prior to admission to the hospital.
*   **Claim Process:** The claim will be processed on a reimbursement basis. The insured person pays the hospital bills upfront and then files for reimbursement.
*   **Document Submission:** The required documents must be submitted to the TPA within 15 days from the date of discharge.

**2. Inpatient Care for Complications (Emergency Hospitalization in a Non-Network Hospital)**

*   **Claim Notification:** The TPA must be notified within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalization or before the patient's discharge, whichever is earlier.
*   **Claim Process:** Since the treatment is in a non-network hospital, the insured person must pay the costs upfront and then submit a claim for reimbursement.
*   **Document Submission:** The required documents must be submitted to the TPA within 15 days from the date of discharge.

### **Required Documents for Reimbursement**

The claim for both events must be supported by the following original documents:
*   Duly completed claim form;
*   Photo ID and Age proof;
*   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;
*   Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.
*   Medical history of the patient as recorded (All previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for current ailment), bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner/ hospital
*   Discharge certificate/ summary from the hospital.
*   Photo ID and Age proof;
*   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;
*   Original final Hospital bill with detailed break-up with all original deposit and final payment receipt;
*   Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery;
*   All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) along with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice / bill with receipt from diagnostic center;
*   All original medicine / pharmacy bills along with the Medical Practitioner's prescription;
*   MLC / FIR copy in Accidental cases only;
*   Copy of death summary and copy of death certificate (in death claims only);
*   Pre and post-operative imaging reports;
*   Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history of the Insured Person, treatment details and the Insured Person's progress;
*   Cheque copy with name of proposer printed on the cheque leaf or copy of the first page of the bank passbook or the bank statement not later than 3 months.

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. Based on the policy terms, the newborn's treatment expenses are eligible for a claim.

The policy specifies that a "Baby Covered from Day 1 within Family Sum Insured" is a benefit when maternity cover is opted for. A "New Born Baby" is defined as a baby born during the policy period, aged up to 90 days.

As an insured person from day one, the newborn is entitled to in-patient hospitalization benefits. This includes charges for accommodation in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), which are covered up to "4% of SI for ICU". Therefore, the intensive care treatment expenses incurred for the newborn before their death are payable under the family's sum insured, subject to the policy's terms and conditions.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, the submitted documents are insufficient for a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment.

**Justification:**

1.  **Eligible Practitioners:** The policy defines a specific group of practitioners for mental health conditions. A "Mental Healthcare Professional" is defined as a psychiatrist, a registered professional, a professional with specific post-graduate degrees in AYUSH, or a Clinical Psychologist. A general practitioner is not included in this specific list for mental healthcare.

2.  **Claim Documentation:** While a discharge summary certified by a Clinical Psychologist is valid as they are a recognized "Mental Healthcare Professional," the prescription must come from a practitioner qualified to treat the specific condition. For a psychiatric condition, this would need to be one of the specialists listed under the "Mental Healthcare Professional" definition, not a general practitioner.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. Based on the annexures provided:

*   **ECG Electrodes:** Up to 5 electrodes are required for every case visiting OT or ICU. For longer stays in ICU, a change may be required, and at least one set every second day is payable.
*   **Gloves:** Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Based on the policy terms, both pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed.

**Pre-hospitalization Medical Expenses:**
The policy covers medical expenses incurred for up to **30 days** immediately preceding the hospitalization. Since the expenses occurred 18 days before admission, they fall within this covered period.

**Post-hospitalization Medical Expenses:**
The policy covers medical expenses, including diagnostics and pharmacy costs, incurred for up to **60 days** immediately after discharge from the hospital. As the expenses occurred 20 days after discharge, they are within the claimable period.

For both types of expenses, the claim is payable provided that:
*   An in-patient hospitalization claim for the same illness was accepted by the insurance company.
*   The expenses are for the same condition for which the insured person was hospitalized.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. Based on the policy's terms:

*   **Eligibility:** Dependent children are covered up to the age of 26, provided they are unmarried and unemployed.
*   **Termination of Cover:** Coverage for a dependent ends when they cease to be a "Dependent." This occurs when the child turns 27. The policy states that cover will end at that point, "unless otherwise agreed specifically for continuation till end of policy period."
*   **Deletion Protocol:** In the event of an employee's death, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. If an insured person is admitted to a room with a rent exceeding the specified limit, the reimbursement for all associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, will be proportionally reduced.

The reimbursement is calculated based on the ratio of the admissible room rent to the actual room rent paid. This is governed by the **Proportionate Clause**, which is detailed in Note 1 of Clause III.A.1, "In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover".

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. Upon identifying a deficiency in the required documentation for a claim, the insurer will intimate the insured person. The insured has 10 working days from the first intimation to provide the missing documents. The insurer will send a maximum of three reminders.

Once the resubmitted documents are received, the insurer has 15 days to communicate a final decision, such as a rejection.

If the insured wishes to contest this final rejection, the following steps can be taken:
1.  **Reconsideration:** Within 15 days of receiving the rejection notice, the insured may request that the insurer reconsider the decision.
2.  **Grievance Redressal:** If unsatisfied with the outcome, the insured can contact the company's grievance redressal channels:

    *   **E-mail:** customercare@uiic.co.in

4.  **IRDAI:** A grievance may also be lodged with the IRDAI Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS).

A claim is considered abandoned if no legal suit or other proceeding is initiated within twelve months from the date of the final rejection.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the **Day Care Treatment** category.

Day Care Treatment is defined as a medical treatment and/or surgical procedure which is:
i. undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement, and

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. For a hospital to qualify under the policy in a town with a population of less than 10,00,000, it must have at least 10 in-patient beds. In all other areas, which includes metropolitan areas, the requirement is at least 15 in-patient beds.

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. For an accident requiring air ambulance evacuation and subsequent inpatient admission, the following steps and documentation are mandatory:

### **Pre-Authorization and Mandatory Requirements**

1.  **Immediate Notification:** In the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, you must immediately notify the insurer or TPA at their call center or in writing.
2.  **Mandatory Pre-authorization:** Emergency medical evacuations must be pre-authorized by the insurer.
3.  **Medical Necessity Assessment:** The insurer's team of specialists, in association with the emergency assistance service provider, will determine the medical necessity of the evacuation before it is approved.
4.  **Hospital Admission:** For the inpatient admission, you must produce the health ID card at the network hospital's insurance desk and complete the cashless request form for TPA pre-authorization.

### **Claims Assessment and Required Documentation**

For the claim to be assessed and settled, the following documentation is required:

**For the Air Ambulance:**

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If an insured person has continuous coverage without any break as defined under the applicable norms on portability stipulated by IRDAI, the waiting period for a specific illness like knee replacement due to osteoarthritis will be reduced to the extent of the prior coverage.

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. No, the expense will not be covered. The policy excludes expenses for any unproven treatment, which is defined as treatment not based on established medical practice in India or that lacks significant medical documentation to support its effectiveness.

According to the policy terms:

*   **Unproven/Experimental Treatment (Definition):** This is defined as treatment, including drug experimental therapy, which is not based on established medical practice in India, is treatment experimental or unproven.
*   **Unproven Treatments (Exclusion Code-Excl16):** The policy excludes expenses related to any unproven treatment, services, and supplies for or in connection with any treatment. Unproven treatments are those that lack significant medical documentation to support their effectiveness.
*   **Medically Necessary Treatment (Definition):** This is defined as treatment that, among other criteria, must conform to the professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India.

While "Medically Necessary Treatment" allows for standards of international medical practice, the specific exclusion for "Unproven/Experimental Treatment" which is defined as not being established in India, would likely take precedence, leading to the denial of the claim for an imported medication not normally used in the country.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. In the event of the death of an employee in an employer-employee group, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured.

For a non-employer group, the rules for deletion of a member are as specified in the Policy Schedule.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. For claims involving implanted devices, the required documentation is the "Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery".

If there is a deficiency in the necessary claim documents, such as providing a generic invoice without the implant sticker, the insurer may, at its sole discretion, deduct the amount of the claim for which the deficiency is intimated and settle the claim if it is otherwise valid under the policy. The insurer will send up to three reminders regarding the deficient documents.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges are eligible for reimbursement under the following circumstances:
*   The service is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse.
*   It is required immediately after hospital treatment.
*   The service is deemed a medical necessity for treatment that would normally be provided in a hospital.

*   The benefit is payable during the post-hospitalization period.

The required documentation is:
*   Bills from a registered nursing service provider.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. In a multi-policy scenario where the primary policy's coverage is less than the admissible claim amount, the following procedure applies:

1.  **Coordination:** The primary insurer will seek the details of the policyholder's other available policies and will coordinate with the other insurers to settle the balance of the claim amount. This is contingent upon a written request for the same being submitted by the Insured Person.

2.  **Documentation:** When original documents have been submitted to the primary insurer, the other insurer may accept the following for processing the claim:
    *   Duly certified documents as listed in the policy.
    *   Claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. No, these expenses are not claimable.

According to the policy's "Standard Permanent Exclusions," expenses for admissions that are primarily for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only are excluded. The policy defines "Medically Necessary Treatment" as care required for the medical management of an illness or injury. Since the evaluation resulted in a decision for no treatment, the stay in the hospital was not for a medically necessary treatment but for investigation, which is explicitly excluded.

Furthermore, the policy excludes any stay in a hospital without undertaking any treatment.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. In the event of the policyholder's death where there is no subsisting nominee, the Company will pay the claim amount to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. The payment is processed upon the legal heir providing a succession certificate or an indemnity bond.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Based on the policy's definitions and exclusions, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered in the following scenarios:

2.  **For routine correction or support:**
    *   Routine eye examination items like spectacles, multifocal lenses, and contact lenses.
    *   Cost of hearing aids.

3.  **Specific external devices:**
    *   Instruments used for Sleep Apnea Syndrome (C.P.A.P.).
    *   Oxygen Concentrators for Bronchial Asthmatic conditions.
    *   Infusion pumps or any other external devices used during or after treatment.

4.  **Non-medical and post-hospitalization equipment:** Expenses for non-medical items for personal comfort or equipment used at home after discharge are not covered. This includes:
    *   Ambulatory devices (walkers, crutches)
    *   Belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind
    *   Diabetic footwear
    *   Glucometer/thermometer
    *   Walking aids
    *   Nebulizer kit
    *   Steam inhaler
    *   Cervical collar
    *   Knee braces

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. No, the expenses will not be reimbursed.

According to the policy's special conditions, AYUSH treatment is covered only in Government Recognised hospitals that are NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) approved. Furthermore, the general definition of a "Hospital" in the policy requires it to be registered with the local authorities. Since the hospital in the scenario is not locally registered, it does not meet the fundamental requirements for coverage, regardless of the practitioners' qualifications.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. In the event of any change in the diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost of treatment during hospitalization, the Network Provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. According to the policy, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim will be processed only after a decision has been made on the main Hospitalisation claim.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A31. The policyholder is M/s DATA SOLUTIONS INDIA, located at 4TH FLOOR, 1, BLOCK A, DLF INDUSTRIAL AREA, SECTOR 32, FARIDABAD HARYANA 121003, HYPA AXIS BANK LTD FARIDABAD, HARYANA 121003.

The specific fields for Telephone, Fax, and Email are left blank in the document.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Answer not present in documents

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. If a claim is found to be fraudulent in any way, or if any false statement or document is used to support it, all benefits under the policy, along with the premium paid, will be forfeited. Any amount that has already been paid for a fraudulent claim must be repaid to the insurer.

For claims with missing documents, the insurer will notify the insured person of the deficiency. If the missing documents are not provided after reminders, the insurer may, at its discretion, deduct the amount related to the deficiency and settle the remainder of the claim if it is otherwise valid.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. Based on the policy terms, reimbursement is generally not provided for expenses unrelated to hospitalization.

The policy covers:
*   **In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses:** Costs incurred when admitted to a hospital for over 24 hours.
*   **Pre-hospitalisation Expenses:** Costs incurred for a specified period *before* an admissible hospitalization.
*   **Post-hospitalisation Expenses:** Costs incurred for a specified period *after* an admissible hospitalization.
*   **Day Care Treatment:** Procedures that require less than 24 hours of hospitalization due to technological advancement.

The policy explicitly excludes conditions for which treatment could have been done on an out-patient basis without any hospitalization. While an "Out-Patient Cover" is mentioned as an optional benefit, it is only available if specifically opted for and included in the policy schedule.

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Based on the document, the following are not covered:

*   **Treatment received outside India.**
*   The geographical scope of the policy applies to events limited to India. All admitted or payable claims are settled in India in Indian rupees.

Q36. How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A36. I cannot fulfill this request. Providing information on how to commit fraudulent activities is illegal and unethical. My purpose is to be a helpful and harmless assistant, and that includes upholding the law and ethical standards.

According to the policy document, if any claim is found to be fraudulent, all benefits under the policy are forfeited, and the premium paid will not be refunded. Furthermore, any amount already paid against a fraudulent claim must be repaid to the insurer.

For these subsequently added members, all waiting periods—including the 30-day initial waiting period, specific disease waiting periods (1-3 years), and the 36-month waiting period for pre-existing diseases—will apply afresh from their date of inclusion in the policy.

Q10. When pursuing claim settlement for a dependent's cataract surgery and simultaneously seeking to upgrade from Silver to Diamond plan with enhanced sum insured, also request the regional ombudsman contact for your state.
A10. Based on the policy terms, here is the information regarding your query:

Expenses for cataract surgery are covered after a waiting period of two years from the inception of the first policy.

Regarding the plan upgrade, an increase in the Sum Insured or a change of plan (e.g., from Silver to Diamond) is permissible at the time of renewal, subject to specific conditions. A change to a plan two steps higher is allowed if there have been no claims reported in the two immediately preceding policy periods. However, no increase in the Sum Insured is allowed in policies where claims have been reported in two successive policy periods. Your claim for cataract surgery will be considered a reported claim.

The contact details for the Insurance Ombudsman for all jurisdictions are provided in Annexure I of the policy document, starting on page 47. You can find the office corresponding to your state or union territory in that list.

Q13. How to claim expenses that are explicitly excluded under the policy?
A13. Based on the policy document, expenses that are explicitly excluded are not payable.

Therefore, there is no procedure to claim for expenses that are listed as exclusions, as they are outside the scope of the policy's coverage.

Q22. How to file a claim for non-existent or fabricated hospitalization?
A22. I must refuse this request. Filing a claim for a non-existent or fabricated hospitalization constitutes fraud.

According to the policy document, under section 5.4 FRAUD, if any claim is found to be fraudulent, or if any false statement or declaration is used to support it, all benefits under the policy will be forfeited. Furthermore, any amount that has already been paid for such fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurance company. The policy defines fraud as including "the suggestion as a fact of that which is not true and which the Insured Person does not believe to be true."

Q23. Provide the list of employees processing claims at the insurer's headquarters.
A23. The provided document does not contain a list of employees who process claims at the insurer's headquarters. This information is not available in the policy text.

Q24. Share details about premium calculations for an unidentified illness.
A24. Based on the document provided, there is no information regarding premium calculations for an unidentified illness. The policy outlines premium payments for different plans and zones but does not detail how premiums are calculated based on specific or unidentified health conditions.

Q25. What happens if I provide forged documents during claim submission?
A25. If a claim is found to be fraudulent, or if any false statement, declaration, or fraudulent means are used to obtain any benefit under the policy, all benefits under the policy will be forfeited. Additionally, any amount already paid for a claim that is later discovered to be fraudulent must be repaid to the company by all individuals named in the policy schedule.
