--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1. Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity (celerity) multiplied by the quantity of matter (mass) in a body. It is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body. In a body with double the mass and equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.

'Force' is distinct from 'quantity of motion' in that motive force arises from the accelerative force multiplied by the quantity of matter. While quantity of motion depends on mass and velocity, force depends on mass and acceleration.

Q2. According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2. Newton’s three laws of motion are:

1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary motion, orbital dynamics, and gravitational interactions. The first law describes how planets move in stable orbits unless influenced by external forces. The second law quantifies how gravitational force causes acceleration of celestial bodies. The third law governs mutual gravitational attraction, ensuring that forces between two bodies, such as a planet and the Sun, are equal and opposite.

Q3. How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3. Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) using his laws of motion and universal gravitation by showing that a planet orbiting the Sun experiences a central force directed toward the Sun. This central force causes the planet's angular momentum to be conserved. Conservation of angular momentum means that the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time, which is Kepler's Second Law. The key concepts are central force, conservation of angular momentum, and the area law.

Q4. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4. Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards each particle of a body is inversely as the square of the distance from that particle. When considering two spheres with similar matter distributed equidistantly from their centers, the gravitational force between them is inversely as the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is confirmed by observing the motions of celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting planets, which follow Kepler’s laws and thus require a centripetal force that varies inversely with the square of the distance from the center. Newton further explains that the total gravitational force from a planet is the sum of the forces from all its parts, each following the inverse square law, and this law holds both for large distances and near the planet’s surface.

Q5. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5. Gravitational force must act on all masses universally because experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies gravitate towards each other in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain. The moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, all planets towards each other, and comets towards the sun. The force of gravity between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This universal gravitation applies to every particle of matter, indicating that all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.

Q6. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6. Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as the result of gravitational forces exerted by other planets. These mutual gravitational attractions cause deviations from perfect elliptical orbits, leading to changes in orbital elements such as eccentricity, inclination, and orientation. The superposition of these forces results in complex, but predictable, variations in planetary motion.

Q7. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7. Newton used the method of fluxions, which involved the concept of quantities flowing or changing with time, as a precursor to calculus in the Principia. He did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred geometric demonstrations modeled after the ancients, and he was reluctant to publish his purely mathematical writings due to his aversion to controversy and disputes. The fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus was first introduced in the second Lemma of the second book of the Principia.

Q8. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8. Newton explains orbital motion by stating that a centripetal force acts continuously on a body moving in a curved path, such as a planet orbiting the Sun. This centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the orbit, causing the body to accelerate toward that center and thus maintain its curved trajectory. In planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, keeping planets in stable orbits around the Sun.

Q9. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9. Newton explains that the resistance experienced by bodies moving in fluids is nearly proportional to the density of the fluid and the square of the velocity of the body. He notes that lighter fluids like air offer less resistance than denser ones like water or mercury, in direct proportion to their densities. The resistance in fluids arises from three sources: the inactivity of the fluid matter, the tenacity of its parts, and friction. For sufficiently fluid substances, resistance is primarily determined by density and velocity squared. Newton also distinguishes that more tenacious fluids resist more than less viscous ones, even if their densities are equal. He provides methods to calculate the resistance and velocity for bodies moving in given curves within such media and confirms his theory with experiments, such as those involving pendulums.

Q10. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10. Newton's notion of absolute space and time asserts that space and time exist independently and uniformly, providing a fixed, unchanging reference frame. Absolute space is the same everywhere and always, unaffected by objects or events, while absolute time flows uniformly regardless of anything external. In contrast, relative motion describes the movement of objects only in relation to each other, not to any fixed background.

Newton's laws, especially the first law (inertia) and the second law (F=ma), require a universal, non-accelerating reference frame to define true motion and acceleration. Absolute space and time provide this framework, allowing Newton to distinguish between true motion (measured against absolute space) and relative motion (measured between objects), ensuring his laws apply consistently and universally.

Q11. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11. Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.

Q12. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12. No, Isaac Newton did not have any descendants. He never married and had no children, so he left no direct lineage.

A4. Based on the policy document, the limits for the specified expenses are as follows:

*   **Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM):** As a modern treatment, expenses for IONM are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).
*   **ICU Care:** Charges for ICU accommodation are limited to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI), inclusive of nursing charges.
*   **City Population:** The policy does not specify any different limits based on the population of the city where care is received.

Q5. A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A5. Based on the policy's eligibility and addition clauses, the process and potential reasons for refusal are as follows:

**Eligibility:**
A 3-year-old child is eligible for coverage as the policy covers children between the ages of 91 days and 18 years, provided that at least one parent is concurrently covered under the policy.

**Process for Addition:**
The policyholder may add the child as an Insured Person during the policy period by following these steps:
1.  Submit an application for cover to the insurer.
2.  Pay the additional premium, which will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for the remaining duration of the policy.
3.  The addition is finalized once the application is accepted by the insurer and a written endorsement confirming the addition is issued.

**Circumstances for Refusal:**
The insurer may refuse to add the child under the following circumstances:
*   If the insurer does not accept the application for cover.
*   If the required additional pro-rata premium is not received by the insurer.
*   If neither parent is concurrently covered under the policy, as this violates the eligibility requirements.

Q6. If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A6. For the day care cataract procedure and subsequent hospitalization for complications, the claim process would be as follows:

### **1. Day Care Cataract Procedure**

*   **Notification of Claim:** For a planned procedure like cataract surgery, you must notify the TPA at least 48 hours prior to admission.
*   **Claim Process:** The claim will be processed on a reimbursement basis. You will need to pay for the treatment upfront and then file for reimbursement.
*   **Document Submission:** You must submit the required documents to the TPA within 15 days from the date of discharge/procedure.

### **2. Inpatient Care for Complications (Non-Network Hospital)**

*   **Notification of Claim:** Since this is an unplanned event, you must notify the TPA within 24 hours from the date of emergency hospitalization or before discharge, whichever is earlier.
*   **Claim Process:** As the treatment is in a non-network hospital, you must pay the bills upfront. The claim will be settled on a reimbursement basis.
*   **Document Submission:** You must submit the required documents to the TPA within 15 days from the date of discharge from the hospital.

### **Required Documents for Reimbursement (for both events)**

The claim must be supported by the following original documents:
*   Duly completed claim form;
*   Photo ID and Age proof;
*   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;
*   Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.
*   Medical history of the patient as recorded (All previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for current ailment), bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner/ hospital
*   Discharge certificate/ summary from the hospital.
*   Photo ID and Age proof;
*   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;
*   Original final Hospital bill with detailed break-up with all original deposit and final payment receipt;
*   Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery;
*   All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) along with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice / bill with receipt from diagnostic center;
*   All original medicine / pharmacy bills along with the Medical Practitioner's prescription;
*   MLC / FIR copy in Accidental cases only;
*   Copy of death summary and copy of death certificate (in death claims only);
*   Pre and post-operative imaging reports;
*   Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history of the Insured Person, treatment details and the Insured Person's progress;
*   Cheque copy with name of proposer printed on the cheque leaf or copy of the first page of the bank passbook or the bank statement not later than 3 months.

Q7. An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A7. Based on the policy terms, the newborn's treatment expenses are eligible for a claim.

According to the "Other Special Condition Details" (SL. No. 1), the policy states, "**Baby Covered from Day 1 within Family Sum Insured**." This provision ensures that any medically necessary treatment for the newborn, including intensive care, is covered from the moment of birth under the family's total sum insured.

The policy defines a **New Born Baby** as a baby born during the Policy period and aged up to 90 days. The standard maternity exclusion (Code-Excl18) does not apply here, as the special conditions explicitly provide for Maternity and Newborn cover. Therefore, the costs for the newborn's intensive care are admissible for a claim.

Q8. If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A8. No, this is not sufficient.

Based on the policy, while a Clinical Psychologist is recognized as a "Mental Healthcare Professional" (Clause II.B.27), the required claim documents specify the need for certification from a "Medical Practitioner."

**Justification:**

1.  **Required Documents (Clause VI.5.1.iv):** The policy requires an "Attending **medical practitioner's** / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending **medical practitioner**."
2.  **Definition of Medical Practitioner (Clause II.A.26):** A Medical Practitioner is defined as a person with a valid registration from the Medical Council of any State or Medical Council of India. A general practitioner fits this definition, but a Clinical Psychologist does not, as they are registered with the Rehabilitation Council of India (as per Clause II.B.11).
3.  **Definition of Psychiatrist (Clause II.B.34):** A Psychiatrist is defined as a *medical practitioner* with a post-graduate degree in psychiatry.

Therefore, while the prescription from the general practitioner is valid, the discharge summary and diagnostic certificate must be from a "Medical Practitioner," such as a Psychiatrist, not a Clinical Psychologist, to be considered sufficient for the claim.

Q9. A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A9. Based on the annexures provided, here is the admissibility of the requested items:

*   **ECG Electrodes:** Payable, with the following constraint: "Up to 5 electrodes are required for every case visiting OT or ICU. For longer stay in ICU, may require a change and at least one set every second day is payable."
*   **Gloves:** Payable, with the following constraint: "Sterilized Gloves payable / unsterilized gloves not payable".

Q10. A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A10. Based on the policy, both pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed.

*   **Pre-hospitalization Expenses:** The policy covers actual medical expenses incurred for up to **30 days** immediately before the date of admission to the hospital. Since the expenses occurred 18 days before admission, they fall within this period and are claimable, provided they are for the same illness that required hospitalization.

*   **Post-hospitalization Expenses:** The policy covers actual medical expenses incurred for up to **60 days** from the date of discharge from the hospital. As the diagnostic and pharmacy expenses were incurred 20 days after discharge, they are within the covered period and can be claimed, provided they are related to the same illness.

Q11. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A11. Based on the policy document, coverage for a dependent child is provided up to the age of 26, provided they are unmarried and unemployed.

According to the termination clause (V.B.15.B.iv), coverage for a dependent ends when they cease to be a dependent (i.e., upon turning 27), "unless otherwise agreed specifically for continuation till end of policy period."

Therefore, if the premium was paid for the entire year, the coverage for the child who turns 27 continues until the expiry of the policy period. The dependent will be deleted from the policy at the time of the next renewal.

Q12. A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A12. If an insured person is admitted to a room with a rent that exceeds the policy's specified limit, the reimbursement for all associated medical expenses, including diagnostic and specialist fees, will be made proportionately.

This means the payment for these expenses will be reduced in the same ratio as the admissible room rent limit bears to the actual room rent paid. This is governed by the **Proportionate Clause**, which is detailed in Note 1 under the In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover (Clause III.A.1.A).

Q13. Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A13. Based on the policy terms, here is the course of action:

1.  **Initial Document Deficiency:** When a claim is submitted with missing documents, the TPA/Insurer will scrutinize it and intimate the Insured Person about the deficiency. The Insured Person has 10 working days from the first intimation to provide the necessary documents. The insurer may send up to three reminders.

2.  **Claim Rejection and Reconsideration:** If the claim is finally rejected after the documents are resubmitted, the company must communicate the rejection in writing, stating the grounds, within 15 days of receiving the final documents. The Insured Person then has 15 days from receiving the rejection to request a reconsideration of the decision from the company.

3.  **Grievance Redressal:** If the Insured Person is not satisfied with the outcome of the reconsideration, they can escalate the grievance through the following channels:
    *   **Company Channels:**
        *   Website: www.uiic.co.in
        *   Toll free: 1800 425 333 33
        *   E-mail: customercare@uiic.co.in

        *   Approach the office of the Insurance Ombudsman for the respective region.
        *   Lodge a grievance at the IRDAI Integrated Grievance Management System: https://igms.irda.gov.in/.

4.  **Limitation of Liability:** It is important to note that if a rejected claim is not the subject of a pending suit or other proceeding within twelve months from the date of rejection, the claim is considered abandoned and the insurer's liability is extinguished.

Q14. An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A14. Yes, the claim is eligible under the **Day Care Treatment** category.

The requirements for Day Care Treatment are:
i. undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement, and
ii. which would have otherwise required a hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.

Q15. When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A15. For a hospital to qualify under this policy, the minimum infrastructure requirements are as follows:

*   **In towns with a population of less than 10,00,000 (1 million):** The hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds.
*   **In all other places (including metropolitan areas):** The hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds.

Additionally, all qualifying hospitals must meet the following criteria:
*   Has qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock.
*   Has qualified medical practitioner(s) in charge round the clock.
*   Has a fully equipped operation theatre of its own where surgical procedures are carried out.
*   Maintains daily records of patients and makes these accessible to the insurance company's authorized personnel.

Q16. A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A16. Based on the policy document, here are the eligibility criteria and the process for the additions:

**Eligibility Criteria:**

*   **New Employee:** Must be a newly appointed employee of the policyholder.
*   **Spouse:** Must be the employee's legal spouse or life partner.
*   **Sibling:** Must be under the age of 26 and be unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.

**Process and Documentation:**

The policyholder (employer) must submit a written request for the additions. The process is as follows:
1.  An application for cover must be submitted for the new members.
2.  The request will be assessed by the underwriter, who may ask for additional information or documents.
3.  An additional premium must be paid on a pro-rata basis for the new members.
4.  Upon acceptance, the insurance company will issue a written endorsement confirming the addition of the new insured persons to the policy.

Q17. Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A17. Robotic surgery for malignancies (cancer) is covered whether performed as an inpatient hospitalization or as a day care procedure. The coverage is subject to a sub-limit, which is "up to the limit as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period for claims involving Robotic Surgeries for... Malignancies."

Q18. If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A18. For an air ambulance evacuation following an accident, the following steps and documentation are required:

### **Pre-authorization for Emergency Evacuation**

1.  **Immediate Notification:** In the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, you or your representative must notify the insurer immediately, either at their call center or in writing.
2.  **Mandatory Pre-authorization:** Emergency medical evacuations must be pre-authorized by the insurer.
3.  **Medical Necessity Assessment:** The insurer's team of specialists, in collaboration with the emergency assistance service provider, will determine the medical necessity of the evacuation or repatriation before it is approved.

### **Required Documentation for Claim Submission**

For the claim to be assessed and settled, you must submit the following documents:

*   **Air Ambulance:** Air ambulance ticket from a registered service provider.
*   **General Inpatient Admission (as per reimbursement procedure):**
    *   Duly completed claim form;
    *   Photo ID and Age proof;
    *   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;
    *   Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.
    *   Medical history of the patient as recorded (All previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for current ailment), bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner/ hospital
    *   Discharge certificate/ summary from the hospital.
    *   Photo ID and Age proof;
    *   Health Card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents;
    *   Original final Hospital bill with detailed break-up with all original deposit and final payment receipt;
    *   Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery;
    *   All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) along with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice / bill with receipt from diagnostic center;
    *   All original medicine / pharmacy bills along with the Medical Practitioner's prescription;
    *   MLC / FIR copy in Accidental cases only;
    *   Copy of death summary and copy of death certificate (in death claims only);
    *   Pre and post-operative imaging reports;
    *   Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history of the Insured Person, treatment details and the Insured Person's progress;
    *   Cheque copy with name of proposer printed on the cheque leaf or copy of the first page of the bank passbook or the bank statement not later than 3 months.

Q19. Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A19. If the Insured Person is continuously covered without any break as defined under the applicable norms on portability stipulated by IRDAI, then the waiting period for a specific illness like knee replacement due to osteoarthritis would be reduced to the extent of the prior coverage.

The list of specific diseases/procedures subject to this waiting period includes:
*   Knee Replacement Surgery (other than caused by an Accident)
*   Non-infectious Arthritis
*   Gout
*   Rheumatism
*   Osteoarthritis and Osteoporosis
*   Joint Replacement Surgery (other than caused by Accident)
*   Prolapse of Intervertebral discs (other than caused by Accident)
*   All Vertebrae Disorders, including but not limited to Spondylitis, Spondylosis, Spondylolisthesis, Congenital Internal Diseases

Q20. If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A20. Based on the policy terms, the expense for an imported medication not normally used in India would likely not be covered. The coverage is subject to the following conditions and exclusions:

*   **Unproven Treatments (Code-Excl16):** The policy excludes expenses for any unproven treatment, which is defined as a treatment that "lacks significant medical documentation to support their effectiveness." An imported drug not standard in India may be classified as unproven.

*   **Medically Necessary Treatment:** For a treatment to be covered, it must be deemed "Medically Necessary." This requires it to, among other things, "conform to the professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India" and not be "experimental, unproven or investigational."

*   **Specific Exclusions (Clause C.7):** The policy explicitly excludes "Any treatment or part of a treatment that... is not a Medically Necessary Treatment."

*   **Geographical Scope (Clause C.20):** The policy excludes "Treatment received outside India." While the patient is in India, the use of a non-standard imported drug could be considered a treatment protocol outside the policy's intended scope.

Q21. A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A21. In the event of the death of an employee, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. For a non-employer group, the rules for deletion of a member are as specified in the Policy Schedule.

Q22. For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A22. For claims involving implanted devices, the required documentation is the "Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery".

If only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, it will be considered a deficiency in the claim documents. The insurer will intimate the insured person about the missing document. If the deficiency is not rectified, the insurer may, at its discretion, deduct the amount of the claim related to the implant and settle the rest of the claim if it is otherwise valid.

Q23. A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A23. Home nursing charges are eligible for reimbursement under the following circumstances:
*   The service is arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to provide expert nursing services at the patient's home.
*   It must take place immediately after hospital treatment.
*   The service must be a medical necessity for treatment that would normally be provided in a hospital.
*   The treating Specialist must have recommended these services.

The required documentation is:
*   Bills from the registered nursing service provider.

Q24. In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A24. In a multi-policy scenario where the primary policy's coverage is less than the admissible claim amount, the following procedure applies:

1.  **Initiation:** The insured person must submit a written request to the primary insurer to coordinate with other insurers for the settlement of the balance amount.
2.  **Coordination:** The primary insurer will then seek the details of the policyholder's other available policies and coordinate with the other insurers to settle the remaining balance of the claim.
3.  **Documentation:** For the claim with the subsequent insurer(s), the company will accept duly certified copies of the required claim documents and the claim settlement advice, which has been duly certified by the primary insurer to which the original documents were submitted.

Q25. Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A25. Based on the policy document, such expenses are not claimable.

The policy contains a specific exclusion for these situations under **Section IV.B. Standard Permanent Exclusions, Clause 4. Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04)**, which states:

*   "Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded;"
*   "Any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded."

Since the hospitalization was solely for evaluation and did not result in any treatment for an illness or injury, the expenses incurred fall directly under this exclusion and are not payable.

Q26. How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A26. In the event of the policyholder's death where there is no subsisting nominee, the company will pay the claim to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. This payment, which constitutes a full and final discharge of the company's liability, is made to the legal heir who holds a succession certificate or an indemnity bond.

Q27. List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A27. Based on the policy's definitions and exclusions, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered in the following scenarios:

1.  **When not required during surgery:** Prostheses, corrective devices, and/or Medical Appliances are not covered if they are not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the person was hospitalized.

2.  **For routine or non-surgical correction:**
    *   Cost of spectacles, multifocal lenses, and contact lenses.
    *   Cost of hearing aids.

3.  **For subsequent home use or long-term management:**
    *   Instruments like C.P.A.P. machines for Sleep Apnea, Oxygen Concentrators for Bronchial Asthma, infusion pumps, or any other external devices used during or after treatment.
    *   Ambulatory devices such as walkers and crutches.
    *   Support items like belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, and stockings (unless specifically covered, e.g., a sling for an upper arm fracture).
    *   Equipment for monitoring, such as diabetic footwear, glucometers, and thermometers, when subsequently used at home.

Q28. If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A28. No, the expenses will not be reimbursed.

According to the policy definitions, an "AYUSH Day Care Centre" must be registered with the local authorities. Similarly, a "Hospital" is defined as an institution registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010, or similar enactments. While having qualified practitioners is a necessary condition, local registration is also a mandatory requirement for the facility to be considered a covered provider under the policy. Therefore, treatment at an unregistered facility is not eligible for reimbursement.

Q29. An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A29. In the event of any change in the diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost of treatment during hospitalization, the Network Provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer/TPA.

Q30. If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A30. According to the policy, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim will be processed only after a decision has been made on the main Hospitalisation claim.

Q31. Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A31. The policyholder is M/s DATA SOLUTIONS INDIA, located at 4TH FLOOR, 1, BLOCK A, DLF INDUSTRIAL AREA, SECTOR 32, FARIDABAD HARYANA 121003, HYPA AXIS BANK LTD FARIDABAD, HARYANA 121003. The document does not provide a telephone number or email address for the policyholder.

Q32. Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A32. Based on the document, claims are not approved automatically. The process requires review and authorization.

**For Cashless Claims:**
The insured person must obtain pre-authorization from the Third Party Administrator (TPA). The TPA reviews the cashless request form and related medical information before issuing a pre-authorization letter to the hospital.

**For Reimbursement Claims:**
The insured person must submit a set of required documents to the TPA after treatment. The TPA/Insurer will then scrutinize the claim form and the accompanying documents to assess the claim.

In both scenarios, the process involves submission, verification, and assessment, not automatic approval.

Q33. What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A33. If a claim is found to be fraudulent in any way, or if a false statement or declaration is used to support it, all benefits under the policy, along with the premium paid, will be forfeited. Any amount that has already been paid for a claim later found to be fraudulent must be repaid to the insurer.

Q34. Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A34. Yes, you can receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization if you have opted for the "Out-Patient Cover," which is an optional benefit.

For this optional cover, the claim process is as follows:
1.  **Submission of claim:** You must submit invoices, the treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports, duly signed by you, to the TPA Head Office.
2.  **Assessment of claim documents:** The TPA will assess the submitted documents to ascertain the admissibility of the claim.
3.  **Settlement & Repudiation of a claim:** The claim will be settled, including its rejection, within 15 days of the receipt of the last necessary document.

Q35. List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A35. Based on the document, the following is excluded:

**Treatment received outside India.**

The policy's geographical scope is limited to events within India, and all claims are settled in India in Indian rupees.

Q36. How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A36. I cannot fulfill this request. Submitting fraudulent claims is an illegal and unethical act, and I cannot provide assistance or information that facilitates such activities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. While checking the process for submitting a dental claim for a 23-year-old financially dependent daughter (who recently married and changed her surname), also confirm the process for updating her last name in the policy records and provide the company's grievance redressal email.
A1. Based on the policy document, a married daughter is ineligible for coverage. Section 2.13.B states, "Female child can be covered until she gets married... If the girl child is married... she shall be ineligible for coverage in the subsequent renewals."

Therefore, a dental claim cannot be submitted for her.

However, the general process for submitting a claim and updating policy details is as follows:

**Claim Documents:**
